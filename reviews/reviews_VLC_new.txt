input: update it is not just youtube i cant get any video to play review this app was working great but i had to do a factory reset on my phone and after reinstalling this app it will not let me watch youtube videos i was able to do it right before i did the reset but now nothing ive tried all of the fixes i could think of and nothing please fix this thanks : 

input: whenever i shuffle songs it doesnt pull from the whole library just from b also when i try and start from a point in m4a or ogg it skips around to predefined intervals untill this is fixed this mobile version is inferior to its desktop counterpart it still functions but at a fraction of the convenience and compatibility factor of its at home program : 

input: strange behavior background media scanning is annoying lately i noticed a strange behavior in the vlc app the background media scan keeps running even though i disabled it yes i could disable the notification but i really dont think there should be any background activity in the first place 1 its annoying and 2 i dont want vlc to scan my files every night : 

input: does not play youtube videosaudio properly many times will not play them at all how to recreate bug create playlist with 2 yt vids play the playlist on repeat wait until the bug shows up also there is no option to create proper stream based playlist with ability to name the tracks instead you get url for track names now it will not play yt videos at all : 

input: the only music player for anyone who wants a decent equalizer slighty clumsier to setup playlists with since you have to queue all the songs and then create playlist from the queue rather than just being able to select a folder and make a playlist out of it occasionally it gets stuck for a split second while playing in the background its a memory and cpu hog too drains many times more battery than other music players clearly in need of optimization indexing is also a bit annoying : 

input: i maintain the player worked better before the update that changed the video player ui whichever it wasafter that i havent been able to download a subtitle properly the player wont play most dual audio files or crashes with some encodeseven after many updates none of these issues have been fixed at least fix the subtitle thing its really annoying : 

input: i love vlc and always have for watching movies on my phone but the fact that there is no way to use chromecast with subtitles makes it so i barely use this anymore i have hard of hearing family members that need subtitles in order to watch on the tv and its incredibly frustrating to cast my entire phone as its so slow i understand that this is an issue with how casting works in general but it makes vlc almost useless for me right now : 

input: uninstalled scanning library everyday after exiting from fly mode even when its setup to not do it and a persistent notification keep showing and you are not able to remove itonly way to remove it is forcing to stop the app even when you didnt use the app best solutionremove the app from your android 10 until devs tell you its solved : 

input: a few last version of the app is super slow at detecting new song the old version version 306 in 2018 and its previous version is better for you guys who still have the old version and you guys dont have any issues i suggest you guys to keep that version installed in your phone do not update : 

input: would have been 5 stars but the network feature fails whenever my isp cuts my subscription now keep in mind that the files i am accessing are on the local wifi network they stay online as long as the machine im streaming from is on vlc however is unable to stream them if i have no active internet subscription how come : 

input: fantastic computer became buggy and started randomly disabling bluetooth so this app gave me the power to transfer my music playlist to something that works equalizer is awesome no hitches when playing audio one thing id question is if theres a limit to audio length as some of my larger files took a couple downloads to work : 

input: trying to stream a f king video url apparently it is refusing to do anything and the fact that the local network isnt detecting my wifi network is part of the problem uninstalled and reinstalled cleared cache and data still the same results what the hell does it take to get anything to work never had this issue and the fact that my phone is connected to wifi but cant stream is also bs : 

input: guys everything was 5 stars but over the last 3 days whenever youre watching something in vlc and then you change tabs to something else and when you change back it doesnt work the app simply crashes and says vlc isnt available or this app isnt available and the problem persists after reinstalling as well i use s10 and update my apps on a 12 hour basis please check i use this app for everything related to video watching : 

input: very glitchy when playing video files off of my external drive through an acer chromebook freezes often and for long periods sometimes audio starts back up after a while but pic still frozen sometimes it will resume if i minimize to taskbar then bring it back up and it plays from where the glitch began on my other laptop vlc for windows plays the same files from the same external drive so its definitely a google issue : 

input: 4 months now i cant pause my show while casting to chromecast without this app crashing i have to force stop it and clear the cache in order for it to even act right just to watch one show im using android oreo if this helps you guysand it still would be nice to use vlc from the computer to chromecast no matter which message board i try to find they all say it works for them and 50 other people say it doesnt : 

input: ive only used it for audio but the program shuts down as soon as it is paused for too long or when another app is opened and the file if opened via an external program is not stored in the vlc play history yet if i reopen it externally in vlc half the time it starts from where it cut off only positives are that its nice to be able to jump to a certain time stamp set up a sleep timer and adjust the playback speed but the rest is bad enough that i will be uninstalling this app : 

input: persistent loading notification on my oneplus 6t for the past month or so happens without opening the app have to force to temporarily get rid of it each time still my go to for casting from my phone to tv but has bugs if i pause a video theres a chance it wont start properly same with rewinding and fast forwarding : 

input: this app has been working great so far especially when i have my bluetooth speakers connected to my phone but now since i updated this app when im watching my movies with my bluetooth speakers it wants to cut the audio out for a few seconds and then comes back on and it does it about every minute through the movie talk about a mood killer please fix this problem cause it really sucks having to watch a movie without my bluetooth speakers : 

input: best free videomusic player out there i have an issue with the music genre tab some albums fall across multiple genres and usually players like windows media player and kodi will allow you to set a delim usually or kodi lets you set it i know media player reads however this player does not read the delimiters and just shows all genres on one line making this tab useless for me i have ocd and have my music catagorized please add support for dsd dff dsf : 

input: i dunno what an app u have created one after the another bug keeps appearing successfully irritating the user screen freezes suddenly subtitle experience is horrible to the core could download one subtitle i tap on download option and it circles and nothing happens should i do the circus of downloading them externally and sync it tell me y shouldnt i jus switch to mx which is near to bug free hope u correct and revamp this app i like vlc thats the reason i keep trying using : 

input: newest update is very disappointing no longer able to delete files unless there are multiple files with the same first 6 characters the fast forward function is different i end up hiding and unhiding the ui half a dozen times before finding the new spot where it will actually fast forward : 

input: disappointed frustrating the brightness seems to be interacting with the videos lighting i think if the videos lighting is dark shot at night the apps brightness tends to also get dark and sometimes the apps brightness bounces from 100 to nothing at all to the point where i cant see anything i updated it to the latest version but alas nothing has changed ive been using vlc for many years now and this is the first time i encountered such thing fix this asap  : 

input: i have this app solely to cast video and it doesnt really do that well at all volume control doesnt work meaning i have to use my tv remote instead of phone to change volume organisation of videos is clunky subtitles do not work i download them through the app and separently through a subtitle website and tried to add them still doesnt work also then doesnt cast the subtitles : 

input: this app having anything other than 4 and 5 start reviews is nonsense open source plays just about anything on any gear you own occasionally has issues if you report them properly as opposed to whinging in a review with a loose it doesnt work they get fixed : 

input: when vlc was the only media player that worked i had a great love in my heart for it however in its current incarnation it is a gigantic buggy mess that largely doesnt work with any of my other tech casting is buggy and constantly freezes and my number one complaint is that the app is continually opening in the background and playing music when i dont ask it to this app is a mess and it only gets 3 stars until they fix : 

input: this app is as good as its desktop counterpart it supports hundreds of file formats and will play anything you their at it for example i couldnt play wma files on google play music but vlc solved ask these problems however theres one bug flac files sometimes appear to have no length this doesnt affect playback but it means you cant skip ahead : 

input: great simple music app i dont like other apps because they all try to get you to stream this one doesnt push stuff you dont want i just wish that playlists were more quickly accessable when browsing your music collection you have to leave audio and select playlists to see them would be better if they were available via the menu at the top of the audio screen were genera artist album etc are located : 

input: plays a lot of popular formats and easy to use but there seems to be a problem with ordered chapter support a few seconds of audio at the end of a chapter and at the start of the next are cut off hope this can be fixed : 

input: why does it randomly cut out at certain points in certain movies while casting seems phone specific though works ok on samsung but the oppo certain movies at a certain point it will just drop ill remove the review after your acknowledgement as this could be the oppo a9 but if possible to look into it and fix it would be amazing  : 

input: introduced new severe bugs on the latest update ab looping is always on for me even when disabled it keeps going back to the same part of the clip frustrating annoying and makes it unuseable im on android 7 i shouldnt have updated vlc was working fine before the 2020 updates : 

input: found no videos yet that i cant play with this there were some interface mishaps here and there along the time before but theyve all ended with couple updates no ads userfriendly design lots of features like speed control and screen lock while watching great work : 

input: love the regular pc version and this app has potential but its just so buggy and broken just some issues when clicking on an audio track it doesnt just play and when done continues to the next but instead it opens a tab at the bottom with only that 1 track on repeatwhen watching a video you cant add it to a playlist instead it will add all videos from your library to that playlist after searching a title of a video you get the wrong 1 when clicking on any found video  : 

input: ive used this app since the beta version and absolutely love it theres nothing even close to it and its free ive given it one star in hopes this gets attention a few updates ago for some reason its started saving a pic locally not on my sd card where the app is for every single mp3 file 10 songs in an album ten pictures saved its an issue due to the amount of music i have on my phone the data size locally is close to 2 gigs can this be fixed : 

input: the app player is really good it will play almost anything but playlist options are really bad there arent any real ways of adding hundreds and hundreds of files to a playlist you have to do everything manually casting is also unreliable with many glitches : 

input: used to love this app so much that i almost hate going to another app because after the latest update the app just stays on a blank screen on start up and this is so annoying tried switching of my network just yo see if it would work but nothing changed im considering to uninstall it for good but for now ill wait for an update and see if this problem goes gets fixed plz fix this app i used to love it so much it would be a pity to let it go : 

input: not smoothly working with chromecast getting disconnected abruptly to move forward and backward for 10 or 15 seconds with buttons would be more user friendly audio playback has quality issues hard bass with jarring sound from vlc is observed while the same track played between vlc other players : 

input: was the biggest fan of vlc across all devices not so much anymore since the last update the volume control is horrible on samsung note 10 trying to play music or video through car stereo system and the sound is so much less then the previous version have to turn volume all the way up in car and still can barely hear it will be using another app until this issue is resolved : 

input: i think vlc is the best all round player however after recent update there is no audio on resume play after closingopening app eg if i have to pause halfway thru a film for some reason and turn off my tablet when i turn my tablet back on vlc asks if id like to resume from last position when i accept i get no sound if i accept start from beginning the sound returns if i try then to skip foward the sound is lost again most annoying : 

input: it would be great if it worked properly when playing a live stream it doesnt retry on a network change so if the wifi reconnects or mobile data changes between eg 1xrtt evdo and lte it just stops playing entirely this is really annoying streaming is literally the only thing i use it for because compared to the windows version this is useless im on an lg v20 which has the high end dac that supports many sample rates and im pretty sure this vlc just uses the android 48khz default : 

input: i use the screen cast screen mirroring option on my oneplus 7t pro and then play videos through vlc since a few days when i play the video after mirroring the screen i see the cast remote icon on the tv same as the screen but the audio plays updated vlc to the latest version but doesnt help using chromecast for the same btw and phone on android 10 please fix : 

input: up to now this has been my number once choice for media player for both android and windows pc for many years my samsung galaxy j4 core worked great with this app until today where it would only open up a blank screen and then crash ive forced stop the app and also uninstalled and reinstalled but still had the same im so very disappointed i cant use the app any more : 

input: the latest update 12 march 2020 broke the best and most comprehensive player available when i load the player it does nothing no playlists no menus nothing as of now this app is only a boat anchor i will wait for the next update if one is forthcoming to decide if i will keep or delete : 

input: what is wrong with it it always crashes when i play mp3 songs every single time i cant even listen to one song properly completely cant you fix it or tell me what am i doing wrong i use bluetooth lg speaker large expensive nokia 2 everything plays fine when i use other players using same device : 

input: the big problem with this app is that every time i start playing a video even if it is the same video i played before it is unlocked which means it can rotate depending on the orientation of my tablet what is needed here is an option in the settings to lock it to landscape mode or portrait mode or to remember the last setting having to rotate the tablet 90 degrees tap the lock button and then rotate the tablet back every time i start playing a video is beep annoying  : 

input: the cast button takes forever to appear if at all i have to cast different apps to chromecast to get it to show in vlc player also i dont like when it continuously scrolls to show all of the title of videos the cast to chromecast problem has been there for many years now i even uninstalled and reinstalled and the new update dont fix it thats why i only use this for the movies that wont cast with my other casting apps : 

input: i always love using vlc on windows but in android there is a problem while playing an audio file if i select a video file from file folder rather than playing vdo file it continues to play audio file solution is very hactic stop the file and exit vlc than select the vdo file other than that it is ok : 

input: lots of bugs has been fixed but there are still 3 most irritating bugs which i am not comfortable with 1 everytime i switch to another app while watching a video and when i switch back the subtitles doesnt show until a replay the video 2 sometimes audio latency does not adjust with bluetooth earphones until you restart the app or adjust audio delay manually 3 sometimes video list shows empty everytime i open the app video list doesnt show until we refresh the list : 

input: overall vlc is great i use it everywhere and love it but unfortunately this time i cannot rate it high why do i have to re type my credentials every time for each folder while browsing an smb file system double on that even if the option to remember the password is ticked please let me see a fix for this this makes the software unusable its unacceptable having to install broken software on systems because of bugs like this when i see a fix i will reconsider my rating sorry : 

input: it used to be great and i used to love vlc but recently it started this new problem in which it does not detect the subtitle file which is present in my deviceandroid i downloaded alot of subtitle files for the same movie but it didnt even detect a single one this was very troubling and i even tried the download subtitle option but it wont work either please fix this problem and i will rate it five stars again : 

input: can not play movies in their original aspect ratio always stretching pictures vertically and want to use exactly as my phones screen size for example original movie has black bar on top and down but this app always want to eliminate it and use full screen that results is awkward i tried all setting but there is not advance setting in new versions i tried other apps like mx player to make sure this is not my phones fault but other apps play well in original aspect ratio : 

input: why is it that the app corrupt my mobile phone all the movies i downloaded was wiped out and if ive watched the movie before and i decided to watch it again it will get to a point that the movie will stop and continue counting the time i cant download the subtitles of the movie i wanna watch again i used to recommend this app before but now im disappointed in the app i dont enjoy watching videos on vlc player again what is happening any solution : 

input: years long of persisting unresolved bugs and unrefinements experienced since 2016 on every android device i use whenever you switch to another app and switch back to vlc the video resets to several minutes back so you have to seek forward where you left off extremely stoopid dumba developers for such a popular app : 

input: vlc is my favorite player on desktop why adroid version of vlc is so different ui is really bad icons on playback arent intuitive especially icons for audio track or subtitle switch audio tracks are mostly delayed file list displays some tags information not filename in my case all files in one folder has same description timebar position is in the lower third not good position fo me unable to chage unable to play vobs as desktop version is able to unable to set to play all files in folder need to use mx player for som filetypes recent version started to crash on my android tv box on start uninstall and instal back helped unable to play wob files : 

input: make sure you back up your sd card this app corrupted mine and i lost all my pictures and videos its buggy with several features that just dont work such as designating only certain folders to be scanned and creating playlists the only good part about this app is that it does infact play videos : 

input: after each update i cant download subtitles anymore its annoying please help fix this asap as i have uninstalled and redownloaded only to meet the same issue whenever i try to download subtitles it brings out the list of subtitles but i cant download the subtitles please again and again help fix this issue : 

input: this is a very good video player app a job well done by videolabs i just got little problem ever since i updated the app to this version i couldnt download subtitles anymore so please review it : 

input: superb player but it doesnt do as it is told after disabling media scanning it still does it and it shows permanent notification instead of being media library app it should be a solid unobtrusive player uninstalled : 

input: its a great app reallythe only issue is downloading subtitles its either saying no network even when my connection is on or when the search finally connects it just keeps loading without actually downloading the subtitles this sucks af : 

input: the best video player out there it was the best on desktop when it came out and its the best on phones able to play all types of video files and all the usual features of a video player are available best part no ads i used to have mx player earlier but since i started using this ive never gone back to it : 

input: using this player for live radio online m3u stream in background mode for an two or three years and elementary bugs still not fixed mmmm whereis delete button or clear in stream history list why this nice player closes where internet switches from mobile to wifi or other way why this nice player do not want to work more than 15 minutes in background every time i have to run player and by hands write down url but now there is memory of urls thanks : 

input: the option about fixing subtitle delay needs to be improved it doesnt work properly sometimes when the time gap is large its hard to increase it in milisecond manual number input option can help here : 

input: doesnt work well with subtitles especially casting it for some reason refuses to show is frustrating if it is hard coded it is fine lots of strange bugs like playing in background but fails to render again when screen turns on again app is just frustrating to use : 

input: plays all the files ok vlc is a standard on android subtitles are not visible during casting to chromecast they are visible when watched on smartphonetablet though i found a workaround to start the video on mobile device with subtitles on theyre visible on mobile screen then cast the whole devices screen from the system menunotifications not from vlc vlc figures out that it is being cast so it stops playing video on mobile device as it plays on chromecast subtitles now show in cast to chromecast however this is a strange mix of cast whole screen and cast video from vlc vlc is aware of the ongoing cast the screen has to stay on no locking although nothing is playing on it just big vlc streaming logo but the subtitles are now visible itd be great to get a fix for this works great from an smb share too : 

input: did not work on my phoenix os but i love it in my windows pc the extra feature i would love to have is the subtitle fetching from opensubtitles automatically more advance would be the auto sync of voice and subtitles if not so of course this is not going to come pretty soon : 

input: app appears to keep running in the background and popping up notifications even with scanning and everything turned off been this way for at least a couple months so im assuming the developers have no intention of fixing it uninstalling and searching for an alternative : 

input: i was happy using my phones own music player huawei then they decided to mess with it so i needed a new player i have this one installed on a tablet so i knew it was a decent player overall ive only given it 4 stars because it doesnt display all the album art and editing track info isnt possible : 

input: this app was the best at first so i decided to update it to the new version which seams to have crashes since ive updated it when i launch it it shows a white black screen please fix this issue on an immediate effect : 

input: it will not open and this bug isnt showing up for the first time my device is samsung a2 core that i up to date on all its software this shouldnt be happening i am very disappointed because i support the pc version of vlc alot : 

input: yet another non comparable mp3 player for this useless samsung 515 vlc like others cannot access device correctly to find files or even have a confirm box to set directly of files stored all permission forced in settings so it should have access but never actually works acts life clean instal every use positive point files can be forced to play by using file browser but if device is sleep mode and no playback app crashes or stops playback reverts to new install state : 

input: since the last update doesnt update new videos in my library no matter how much i wait besides that it doesnt allow me to delete any files although i have given the necessary permission other than thatgood old vlc all that on a note 9 with 90 : 

input: 3 stars everything is okay but the local media streamingafter the latest update local network is not working properlyearlier i used to watch videos of my computer in my smartphone using vlc local share option nnnn in my computer settings sharing is on and even i check windows firewall settingsnothing wrong form my computer computer sharing configuration is perfectly set : 

input: after opening a media file via file manager on minimising the app and while trying to return to the app it shows app isnt available just for this reason i am giving it 1 star this is a great app but this issue makes it unusable even after a couple of updates it wasnt fixed suggestion insert the name of file in manual search of subtitle by default editing is easy instead of typing the whole name android one mi a3 android version 10 user : 

input: used to be essential being the only android app that could play action cam video gopro etc files but not anymore it just does nothing when you try to play such a video no error message appears to start the video then just goes back to the file browser screen useless to me now  : 

input: the app hangs when starting up if it is running from an sd card it the app is moved back to device memory it runs without problems android shows that this app can be moved to sd storage but vlc does not run when that is done looking for an media player app that can actually run from sd storage to spare my limited phone memory : 

input: i have used vlc on windows linux several distros several tablets and phones never any issues it just works there is a pause when refreshing the music library on mobile devices but then i carry 56 gigs of flac music files so it is to be expected : 

input: this app is very poor when a video is played on tv via casting frequently disconnected really disappointing its been a month now since i put a comment and still the same getting worse every passing day sad : 

input: best video player app for phones only problem is it doesnt play all videos when you open a folder if video files you have to go out of your way to make a playlist for them which is a pain : 

input: it lags the video and its too hard to pause it whenever i hit the pause button it lags the video so i just double tap it to stop but turns out it flashforward its kinda annoying i thought this will help me watch videos and movies unlike on my video player but it is kinda worst i have vlc on my phone last time but not like this : 

input: app is good but ui is not smooth and easy to use in mx player you need to work on your subtitles downloader as it doesnt seems to be finding the file properly manual search is completely useless in it dark theme needs to be changed to amoled black which can save battery : 

input: good appbut i dont like only one pointi change orientation from setting set portraitafter when i change from video screen orientation iconthat time first one toast display and after i need to touch that icon againand i miss that 45 second video part because i stuck in video orientation change why i cant change directly touch on screenby the wayi dont like and dont want use automatically orientation by mobilei want maemuellyhow to do that without toast : 

input: i have been using this app since 2015 and it has always been good no crash whatsoever until last week im unable to download subtitles it just keeps saying error occured and my friends have the same issue some already deleted the app you guys should plesse look into it : 

input: the app is fine but the problem is that if we receive a phone call while watching a video we cannot continue instead we have to close the app and restart it and in the process the video starts from beginning and we have to go for searching where we were hope this problem will be fixed at the earliest : 

input: this app is so incompetent that it leaves a persistent notification that cant be swiped away saying that im playing a locallystored video but yet cant save my place on sad locallystored video because its longer than 20 minutesif its an issue of a budget 50 phone with low ram than just save my place and catche it i for one am getting sick and tired of having to take screenshots of where i am in a video because this stupid app cant save my place : 

input: its perfect but playing hevc is still very bad its laggy and slow on the other hand all other media players work very good with hevc without any lags i hope you could fix this problem soon : 

input: when i cast from vlc player there will be times where it runs smoothly for an hour other times it will stop for no reason forcing me to recast to my screen its mad annoying when i have to do this every 5 minutes any solutions to this problem : 

input: close to 20 years of awesomeness they heart apparently in the right right place i not aware of any other open source media player that can handle any kind of format if the file in question has gotten messed up some or bitrot itll still try viva la vlc 28 03 2020 melbourne cbd in the spooky wrong covid19 vibenew normal dang m : 

input: generally it does appear to be a good all round media player however i have to drop a star since with last update the subtitles for videos played in landscape mode are not formated to the scale of the displayed video and as such unusable brilliant for use with dlna pity about subtitles : 

input: in contrast to the pc version of this app it sucks there are many better video players on the play store it is too simple i cant see the codec used by the video or the resolution when the video is playing i only use it because it has no ads and supports a wide variety of formats : 

input: amazing that it doesnt have an annoying ads but it takes too long to parse the data and there are no next option you have to exit the video and click the next one : 

input: ive been using vlc for years on both android and pc best cross format player around imho still works great even with android 10 and 9 feature request add playlist tab to main tabs i hate having to dig into the settings to get to my playlists o : 

input: i was using beta version of this app and there was a problem this app saves album art of all my music in an unhidden folder due to which album art was visible on my gallery i wasnt expecting such a minor bug from team vlc : 

input: the download subtitle part never works how can you put something for our use and still make it useless it will always redirect you to where they wrote manual search even after clicking on it it still doesnt work : 

input: parsing takes forever one is not able to select a specific folder to scan only internal or external storage selecting external storage all folders are selected and you cannot deselect any : 

input: twice now in the past couple of months i have had all my tv shows and movies downloaded here and twice within a couple of days most or partial of them are gone i dont know if this has to do with an update but whatever it is its not working frustrating having to go back and put them in again please fix this : 

input: theres some problems with the ab playback with the button not changing when you disable it after using it another thing that kind of annoys me is when i do the repeat song option it only stays on that song when trying to advance my current list of songs other than that love the app : 

input: this has been my goto app for years for media files however its ui has become somewhat cranky lately sometimes the play all button doesnt show up in the 3211 release on my samsung if i move app from internal memory to sd card the ui disappears entirely until i move it back : 

input: last update is to bad when i play video song or any other video into audio it come back and the audio player hide please fix it : 

input: its good but im experiencing the following bug the last second of every song is cut by the player this is especially annoying when the songs on an album are composed such that they transition nicely from one song to the next at least with a good player they do pls fix asap  : 

input: i dont know whats going on but this has been my apps for many many years even on my laptop sense this new update it doesnt even cast it recycles on the main page by it self an it doesnt go into portrait mode this is weird an crazy not like vlc : 

input: great app no ads never annoys me its such a good app one of the best on google play store only one problem if i resume a paused video the sound doesnt come for a second and then its all okay : 

input: its not quite the former app before the update now i am unable to download subtitles it stopped working since like 5 updates ago vlc needs to fix this cos ive been going through the pain of having to download manually from my browser and attaching to the app thats old school pls fix : 

input: the only thing that bothers me about this app is that when i append a song to play next this popup thing comes up at the bottom of the screen which doesnt allow me to access the queue of songs : 

input: this is a great app but i hope you fix bugs like sometimes when i connect my airpods to my phone it suddenly plays a video thats is similar when playing a music in this app even though i am not using the app and its kinda irritating : 

input: getting fed up of this app always says cannot render to tv made a playlist just flashes screen black and closes it literally doesnt work for anything even when it does work it randomly closes without saving progress completely useless app : 

input: good really but over my phone it works only with videos for the audio it pauses automatically my phone goes to sleep mode i tried reistalling but still that problem persisted : 

input: when we go back to home screen and then try to continue watching it stop workingwe need to play the video from the beginningits so annoyingneed to fix this serious bug : 

input: was absolutely great until last update now i cant play video as audio it will just crash if i try using verizon note9 edit ive figured the issue its working great now it was not your fault it was some other software i was running that caused it to crash : 

input: was a good app to begin with reduced to one star from 5 because it doesnt always see my external memory card there are other apps now which can and are keeping up with the latest tech will soon uninstall if you dont fix wake up you lot : 

input: bug in playback history i have unchecking it but its stil save its state so i have to clear playback history in advanced download subtitles not working anymore error in group videos by name resulting in some file etc webm being no media files found please transfer some file otherwise option is listed normally : 

input: i recently downloaded this app and i must say its actually the best so far but the only problem is that when i add a subtitle it works but the speaker speaks before the subtitle appears it does not come at once with the speaker please i need reply : 

input: i love vlc since childhood really but recently ive been having this issue on my phone i am using a redmi note 8 which has a 1859 aspect ratio when i go to fill screen for video to get best experience of viewing the subtitles move off the screen tried many workarounds but nothing please fix this issue : 

input: i been using vlc player for a long time nowyears and yearsand i can honestly say that i cant recall a time when there was an update that made me feel like i need to pay money to use a top of the line media player so yeahthats my experience  : 

input: getting there a lot of features added since last visit especially with smb file system although im experiencing a hiccup with my s20 and pixel 4 running android 10 it askes for authentication required everytime with remember password ticked while my tab s4 on android 9 running no problem :

input: unusable always gets stuck on scanning media library i dont want you to scan my media library and make my whole phone sluggish i will share a file to you when i want to use you i do not want you to go through all my files and make me wait forever for it :

input: good app but please allow something as basic as changing the subtitle position as when i switch the aspect ratio to fit screen the subs get hidden off the bottom edge of the screen which is really annoying : 

input: when i try to resume playing a video from the notification center after a little while it plays a different file instead what is supposed to play so i end up having to launch the app and finding the file from my folders and play it : 

input: everytime i open this app it goes into searching for media which i dont mind but what i do mind is it taking 5 minutes for a bunch of videos what is wrong with this app : 

input: the only problem i had was that while playing on tv i cant turn subtitles on otherwise the best media player : 

input: thanks for your great app but i have a problem with it since ive installed it on my android tv also its interface does not work properly and most of thime crashes at the begining like all of the folders icones are mixed up so i appreciate if you can fix it on rhe tv adapted interface :

input: its all fine but i recommend that there must be 1 option more in show the list of video that is sort by date option too : 

input: good but not quite has a problem with playing audio in hd mkv files please fix this has been my best player but im uninstalling because of this : 

input: pretty much all you need in a music player simple to use no ads popping up and no obscure permissions required : 

input: good with the additional volume but doesnt keep records of last stopped or automatically move to the next video : 

input: no option to resume continue play audio files if we stopped and closed app the audio files are again started from starting pointthey are not resumed where they stopped last time : 

input: loading notification issue appears randomly then wont go away without force stopping uninstalled deleted all date cache etc just keeps happening will stop using until fixed : 

input: the app works well enough there is a consistent issue new files downloaded onto the phone are not visible in the file selector : 

input: would be much better if it didnt reloadparse the music library every time you opened it the playlist action could be better its really confusing and slow : 

input: why cant it maintain screen rotation off of samsung tab it just rotates screen on its own until we lock the video then there we cant forward or reverse the video  : 

input: nice app but in the updated version after watching a movie when going back it becomes blank that youll have to restart the app : 

input: excellent but dont move to external storage or you will break it completely : 

input: doesnt work every technical and ads pop up in the middle of programming that will not allow you exit them yeah and shouldnt waste your time at all sorry : 

input: video that were deleted are still showing even after refreshing the page and for the new videos sometimes theye are comming up but sometimes dont :

input: was very good best video player app before the latest update now it has become a ordinary video player hope to get the previous version app : 

input: i downloaded this mainy because of its ability to download subtitlesbut unfortunately i have not been able to download any subtitle always saying error occurred please if this is not resolved i might be tempted to delete it : 

input: great app but would be best to add the preferences feature just like in the pc version to save preferred audio and subtitle : 

input: almost perfect but wish it had more headset button presets like press three times to restart or go back to previous song : 

input: frequently reloads and fails to play also very ineffective when selecting other item from different group reloades forever just isnt efficient as it used to be : 

input: it works well but my only problem is that the mini player isnt available for me even though i had tweaked the settings and enabled the pictureinpicture function : 

input: my video library with update still looks terrible in the new version no grid if to group videos and i have to scroll one column from top to bottom : 

input: i cant download movie subtitle to help me understand languages which arent english i do find the subtitles after the search but after taping on it it doesnt download the subtitles :

input: updates with spelling mistakes also i am unable to download subtitles subtitle search gives same popup but on click of download nothing happens : 

input: taking long time to load files also disconnects multiple times while casting on smart tv :

input: its the only app which can play video of any format even when the video is incomplete : 

input: the new updates are terrible they make the product almost completely unusable compared to previous versions it should not take 10 seconds or more to load a playlist and i dont care how many tracks there are on the playlist playlists linger after i have tried to delete them the only thing the updates have fixed is blank playlists showing up thats still simply not good enough if the trade off is an app that lags so much youre considering using the crappy preinstalled app nonsense :

input: cant compatible with android 10 disappointing : 

input: i recently updated vlc on my phone now it doesnt work : 

input: why does it have a 1notification constantly but nothing shows when open app : 

input: was once the best player on the market but i guess too much customers overwhelmed the developers the play as audio function sucks it records where you stopped while playing the file and the next time you open that file it starts from that point only problem is that it will start from that point forever until you delete and re upload the file to your system and the cycle continues when you turn this remember last play position off the app disobeys you nothing happens : 

input: not happy about the position lost every now and again great app but im looking for another one : 

input: thanks mate i have a video format that error but with thus it can play : 

input: i love the download subtitle feature it just loved it  : 

input: persistent grey screen problem please fix it : 

input: better than mx i used mx for 5 years than i shifted to vlc and i prefer to use vlc but i dont know what is the reason while casting video after playing well for around 3 4 minutes video stuck at shows buffering i tried number of times by different methods same problem persists thank you :

input: app is crashing while switching from uc player to vlc player please solve this problem :

input: its a nice appbut playing 4k movies is a real problem what can i do :

input: doesnt show any music ive bought on the play store almost as useless as the default music app : 

input: this modern tech lets you have 4k would like to see vlc support 4k some day edit found out vlc can but why are not all the options available in settings : 

input: i love this but for some reason i cant play one punch man s2 : 

input: no select all option in directory browser : 

input: dysfunctional frustrating lame settings paused video disonnects casting and begins playing on my tablet at a random time or another video timeline repeatedly vanishes and makes resuming video at select points frustrating and embarrassing audiences highly over rated app does not play well on my samsung tablet okay to watch a nonstop video but stop and go doesnt conform to a pleasant experience nothing like the computer version icon signifies that you should avoid this half baked app : 

input: whats happening with this latest version its not oppening on my a2 core  : 

input: the brightness keeps changing its so annoying just fix this please : 

input: ive been trying to download subtitle file is difficult  : 

input: i like the previous version the new version have worst control and features : 

input: constantly crashes when using with chromecast : 

input: im downloading the subtitles files repeatedly but they are appearing no where while playing a movie i have even tried to find that srt subtitle file in my file manager to search its location but i cant find it please fix this issue asap select subtitle file option is also tried by multiple times but there is no sign of the downloaded subtitle file so how can i select this issue is making me crazy while watching movies its been 2 days this problem is happening to me : 

input: why does it stop playing when my phone screen goes to sleep : 

input: new update and no longer functions please fix : 

input: most videos are frozen and only play sound webm : 

input: audio is too slow video is faster than audio : 

input: everything is good but cant we delete multiple videos at the same time : 

input: enamy front is very bad lag in game is hang new update is new problem : 

input: cannot find a video in the internal memory does not appear as an option on open with : 

input: lot of bugs when we add subtitles : 

input: resize options are all the same aspect ratio showing the same vertically stretched picture for lots of videos except 34 which is not helping most 4k videos mkv gets stretched hd movies also get stretched if i use another player like youyube and then go back to vlc only way to fix it is to restart the box that only fix hd though tried reinstalling but no luck it refuses to show black bars at the top and bottom of the screen box is minix u1 : 

input: this new update is pathetic this is thr reason why sometimes i just stick to the old update nomatter how many times i am reminded to nomatter what i do to rectify the settings and put my preferences it takes itself back to default settings the light adjusts itself the video starts all over even after my settings clearly says ask me to resume its annoying i hope the next available update will fix these bugs because am ready to move on from this app : 

input: i love vlc had it for years on my pc on the phone ive stuck with it while it develops and improves my only problems on the phone are two things firstly the auto volume reduction when it thinks the vol is too high it would be great to disable this why because i dont just feed it to headphones i play back through a hifi system and its annoying it randomly reduces the volume withiut warning two the auto scrolling of file titles really really annoying when they are long  : 

input: subtitle download doest work work on it please : 

input: buttons not workingnext song and previous song : 

input: it crashes while casting and playing a playlist : 

input: cant resume after pause pl fix this bug : 

input: vlc plays all video files and codecs i am able to download or record including many lesser known or foreign types is open source and well tested and has few bugs and issues there are certainly some features i wish were added such as a more intuitive basic interface a better delineation bwtween advanced and basic features and tools such as conversion and other features available in the desktop version but this app is awesome for most if not all video foles i watch on android : 

input: its ok but it doesnt subtitle why : 

input: i have playing video and cast my screen on mi tv via chromecast but video not playing well : 

input: this new update is terrible lots of bugs : 

input: no equalizer cant adjust between earphone types : 

input: chromecast mkv file not working properly : 

input: latest updates have ruined the performance scrolling backward n forward either pauses or jumps randomly anywhere i dont know why it remembers some random duration of a video played and then plays it from the same spot again and again when put on replay scrolling within 10s of interval a stupid update now i have to stupidly watch the video 10s backward before reaching an exact time extremely irritating when watching some long lectures or presentation screen orientation is also bad now : 

input: last update fails to start on my lenovo phab 2 plus : 

input: was good but now have to continuously reinstall to add music to my list : 

input: its crashing from last 2 or 3 update i am going to uninstall it : 

input: crashes immediately if installed on sd card : 

input: doesnt play well with chromecast as many say : 

input: you tube videos are not playing while using shar button in oneplus mobile : 

input: thumbnail doesnt disappear when video is deleted : 

input: the video player is good as i have used it for years on windowspc but on android its not good as it used to be it try to pick up the same style as of pc which quite doesnt suit it as windows and android are different platforms and one more thing its video decoder is not at all good there are frame buffering and frame skipping also which is not a good thing so please update it in a good old fashioned way and make it no1 player on android : 

input: in my opinion as a performing and recording artist its a wonderful at perhaps number one been using vlc products since they have been on the available and open source and copyleft theyre very good people to makes this a free application but hey they are after all french i speak french que je te quand je veux voir sil vous pla t : 

input: nice app i really love this app but i cant use one feature on it and that is the subtitle download feature sometimes i will not get any results when i search and sometimes too i will get but can not download especially when im using a video i downloaded with uc browser i will be very happy if this is fixed and i will give it 5  : 

input: i would like to ask if why all of my movie clips doesnt show in this app : 

input: best appi didnt thought that it would play m38u file also but this file only runs on internet : 

input: i have a very good expeirence with this appbut there are few bugs and suggestions that will help 1in equalizer the bass mode does not work 2the volume of video conflicts with the system volumein simple words when volume is kept to 200 the volume is acutally not at its fullest i have to increase it from volume button also 3please add music visualizer like pc version or write a new app for that : 

input: the previous version looks better according to me compared to the latest version sometimes it doesnt update my media files until uninstall and install it again on the good side it has a pretty good equalizer making it the best to use with my headset : 

input: play video 4k hdr so bad and subtitle to stumble : 

input: absolutely appalling when playing via a chromecast if you try to move forward a few seconds the app closes when you pause then try to play whatever youre watching plays on the device not the tv and its audio only no video dont bother installing : 

input: short by name has a big bug its short number 1 then 10 11 1219 then 2 20 21 please resolve this issue : 

input: cant load subtitle srt file on my realme 3 device : 

input: very poor sound reproduction quality : 

input: vlc got it volume to a max of 200 what is more cool than that : 

input: i wish i could say this is a perfect app but it isnt the subtitle download doesnt work anymore every time you go out of the app it starts the video from the beginning and if youre using this app as a host it crashes every 15 minutes this app just isnt what it used to be : 

input: while playing video no back button in poco f1 gesture modefix this : 

input: after update in end of february the vlc player is suddenly playing off video file in smb lan crashing playing file not application before the update it is working nice but after update it is crashing after 45 minutes of playing video you should do this as early as you can my mobile is samsung galaxy s9 plus :

input: im having trouble with my video playback mp4 : 

input: can you make volume gesture precise like brightness gesture also making it fast when you swipe too quick : 

input: it is very very irritatingbecause when ever you touch the screen the navigation bar and top bar is come and go at video playerit is one of the bad feature in this app please remove itbecause previous 1 year i use this app but is feature is came i think before 3 monthsafter i has use the mx player the app is really userfriendly but the ads is irritating that is other departmenti suggest please more options are included the settings that is smodify the player interface thankyou thank : 

input: ave tried many players but i always come back to vlc principally coz of its ability to give excellent audio quality the only misgiving is since the last update track titles roll right to left when selecting my playlist its irritating to wait for the app to settle so i can see the song titles fix it : 

input: needs new uiit feels obsolete otherwise its fantastic  : 

input: the network feature is borked it asks for smb v1 user and pasword on every folder : 

input: this application not open why people give 5 star why i want give 0 i think thats not user only their developer who give 5 star themselves : 

input: sub not showing in the video even after download : 

input: doesnt list all available devices on network : 

input: this app is buggy on my phone sometme i listen music with my headphones when a song ended and switch to next song it will suddenly play it with my speaker very loudly sometime it switch to a video i previously watched but it is not in my playlist so annoying this app is : 

input: vlc doesnt have the best interface for subtitle settings and such but it shows no ads unlike mx player and you bet it has every functionality imaginable for a media player : 

input: what did you dogo from perfect to stupid how can it not read subtitles already in the damn app : 

input: the desktop version of vlc has a bookmark option the app needs this and sometimes instead of resuming the audiobook file i listen to it goes back to directories and i have to guess where i was in the book because it doesnt save where it cut off : 

input: i have used vlc for about a decade on linux windows android and my only issue has ever been was finding enough time to listen to my huge music collection all jokes aside its a great application and i will continue to use it for years to come across a pletora of devices : 

input: i have tried now for 4 months to play on my lenovo ytx705f tablet to watch on 4k content and waited for an update but it does not work it is freezing after 3 seconds and i have only sound i read and watched on youtube all kind of settings and now success please help me out : 

input: im really upset that now you cannot disable the video on your mobile device while casting there used to be an option to toggle phone screen off to save power but has since been removed in an update such a shame been using vlc since it released long time user scorned lol help : 

input: i cant download any subtitles online in vlc : 

input: this app doesnt show anything just a blank screen im disappointed : 

input: you should add subtitle position changing options : 

input: ftp file list is broken after adding the ftp server it doesnt load the file list when trying to open or play it locally it can but is not possible when using a dynamic dns to use it as a personal cloud : 

input: why cannot play 360 video i read from videolan web that vlc should support 360 from 300 isnt it : 

input: solve the problem with subtitles on casting please  : 

input: cant able to download subtitles from it : 

input: there are still videos i cant watch using vlc : 

input: refresh button not working also the auto rescan in the settings : 

input: fantastic app way better than the player built into my phone but there is a glitch that didnt exist before the dec 23rd update when playing music you used to be able to skip songs by holding the volume buttons please fix this vlc i hate navigating the screen in order to change to the next song i would give 5 stars but i really hate this bug : 

input: i thought i would explain further now that 3 weeks have gone by and i havent seen any changes to the subtitle issue first i should say i am using vlc on my sony android tv before the latest update it was easy to add in a saved subtitle file srt using the tv remote you could navigate to the file and press ok and it would be added to the movie after the update using the remote you can navigate to the subtitle file but you cant move the cursor to highlight the file and select it the only way you can do this is by using a mouse a real pain further before when you selected the file you got a popup saying the subtitle had been added now no indication sure hope someone reads this and fixes it with the next release as it is really spoiling an otherwise great app : 

input: i have tried several different players and this one has been the best of them all i even useused it on my cpu which recently passed away i guess 15 years is kind of old in hard drive years i hadnt even started to fill up the terabyte it held still all my pictures and music and stuff vlc had codecs that others didnt and when i found it bam baby the music file played just great ive not had any problems with vlc on my cpu or my phone so it gets 5 stars from me  : 

input: please fix video play audio interuption it really sucks : 

input: casting issue with chrome cast application : 

input: this app is really unsafe in terms of ones privacy explicitly set it up not to scan and not to sync but it still does that on every single startup just makes you wonder what else it does behind ones back uninstalling dont need yet another spying app : 

input: very unreliable when casting and converting : 

input: ive been using vlc for years desktop and android versions since the latest update ive been having a little trouble with screen ratio not auto adjusting on my acer chromebook 15 once i load a video it will play but the bottom of the screen is cut off where the play button is in which i have to manually press pause than play again to fix the aspect ratio of the screen size not a big deal and i hope it makes sense the way i explained i can send a picture however : 

input: this used to be the best video player app not any more was it really absolutely necessary to screw it all up with your constant compulsive development 10 years ago vlc was just perfect now it is unable to handle subtitles it is struggling with the aspect ratio the whole user experience has gone down the drain what a shame : 

input: the last update and interface changes are not great i use this on my android tv it used to play an episode then stop now if there are multiple videos in a folder it just continues to play until i get to the end additionally with the current video layout if i am in a folder with whole tv season say 20 episodes they are shown on multiple lines when i get to the last video in a line i click arrow across to get to the next episode but it goes nowhere i have to arrow down to the next line then scroll back across to get the the next episode i would prefer the option to go back to the previous layout with videos all shown on one line used to be a 5 star app : 

input: its good because it have support more video formats : 

input: cant even install the app note 10  : 

input: this is the only program that allows me to easily play any audio or video type file including dashcam mov files on my android px i have not had any glitch issues with it either it is a must have in both my android and pc : 

input: will only show 13 files from a set top box using dlna windows media player and other players list all files i have 2 dlna servers a twonky server running on a nas and the server installed upon humax set top box problem occurs upon both servers but only with vlc could it be a dtcp problem : 

input: i love vlc been using it for years but recently when i cast from it it plays perfectly for 40mins to an hour then it stops it will refuse to recast and this problem continues forever until the next day can you fix this whats going on : 

input: previous phones and installations usually worked except for feature removals oneplus 7 pro doesnt everything since the last update claims a xvid codec needed even audio and windows vid files uninstall and reinstall for same result : 

input: sometimes vlc closes for no reason even if i set it on high priority always on the random shuffle play mode in a playlist keeps playing same songs some several times and completely ignores others it does not remember what playlist song was playing last time you used it for example i listened a playlist for an hour paused it didnt close the app for an hour or two wanted to continue listening vlc opens in home screen mode what would you like to listen to today not cool : 

input: heres a use case background play is enabled i start playing a folder filled with both audio and video files then lock the screen works fine until the audio files are played but when a video is played it stops playing until i unlock and select play as audio solution sorta activate the play as audio option automatically when two conditions are met 1 the phone is locked 2 next file to be played is a video ie in a playlist containing mixed media vlc rocks : 

input: vlc was always one of the best until it hit the android os im taking 1 star because it doesnt always save my location in a video after closing the app if i close it off while projecting my phone to my tv it usually doesnt save its annoying so i wouldnt mind a bookmark feature eventually you can bookmark on the desktop version so i dont know why android doesnt have it : 

input: seek track is impossible to use whether i hold the fast forward or rewind button tap the progress bar drag the dot on the progress bar or input seek time manually nothing works the behavior is erratic this app is impossible to use for listening to audiobooks 8 hours in one sitting with no breaks isnt reasonable but required for this app to function ive spent less time listening and more time seeking the spot i left off at awful : 

input: my subtitle is not working why : 

input: i mainly use the app to stream to a chromecast from my nas drive unfortunately this app is by far the worst for streaming and has been for some time it constantly locks up and i have to reset my chromecast this does not happen for any other apps playback of local files is fine but as stated my main use case is streaming and i believe a lot more developing needs to be put into strengthening the streaming capabilities of this app : 

input: clean interface intuitive navigation plenty of features no ads incredibly userfriendly edit the subtitles do not load in the middle only if you have playback running where the subtitle first appears on my device subtitle settings change nothing pulling from the edge of the device for dropdown menus affects the appchanging volumebrightness like if you wanted to turn on wifi from the top menu scrubbing is not intuitive : 

input: i was just watching a couple of hours ago and using the nextforward button which is to the right of the playpause button like how it is on most players now the forward button is gone and the landscapeportrait mode replaced it and there is nothing in the options menu to bring it back what the heck are you doing vlc gets worse instead of better im using x player until you fix things all players should have the back play forward buttons in that orientation quit fooling around : 

input: i love this app well ported for android however its created a thumbnails database of over 500mb which seems unnecessary given that android already has thumbnails for the files i think andbut also that most of these files are audio so vlc must have made a thumbnail for every track using its artwork this is massively redundant and has made my phone unusable due to storage limitations please fix this ive uninstalled everything else that i can cope without : 

input: sadly this app does not live up to its desktop reputation it always starts at full blast on volume it ignores the current volume settings on the phone once you gently tap the volume down button it jumps to the were it should be when listening to a playlist there is no random or repeat button on the screen : 

input: subtitles delay timing not available : 

input: video crashed and start from beginning : 

input: the update is not loading all the music on my sd card only loads about 100 and i have 2000 also very slow to load i want to roll back cause vlc was working fine before if it aint broke dont fix it this is ridiculous everytime youll release and update its broken test the thing properly keeps crashing now : 

input: vlc plays all types of media files including many with unusual or advanced audio formats playback is always smooth video and audio are synced most of the time except when streaming to a fire stick or using the fire stick version of this app another major shortcoming is when streaming mkv files containing dts or dolby digital audio to a chromecast the auto remains synced but the app downgrades the audio to 20 channel stereo and removes the bass channel other similar apps dont do that : 

input: my go to when it comes to a 3rd party media player but ive had a few issues mostly with background playback in other apps and screen locked where it would continue to play for a few seconds and then go silent opening with no media queued edit of the edit also doesnt seem to happen over bluetooth all that much primarily over analog earphones : 

input: i have tried many times to download subtitles but its not working anymore please fix this issue cause i love everything about this app oh and theres some issue with the subtitle adjusting too : 

input: after the new update half the features dont work the ui was polished tho so i guess thats a plus scratch that as of 9th jan 2020 all the features i used vlc for no longer work it doesnt save the last played video in playlist doesnt save my position in a video i was playing doesnt move to the next episode in a playlist doesnt let me get into some menus its officially unusable : 

input: best player with subtile playing feature : 

input: it suddenly stops the video when i drag seek only drag seeks and its mildly infuriating it should keep playing without interruption when i drag seek thats how it is in the previous versions it doesnt happen everytime but 85 of the time it does huawei pro lite model doesnt even matter since my friends with different phones have this problem too : 

input: the newer updates have made using the fast forwardrewind volume control pauseplay etc into a nightmare of triggering issues ill try and swipe the volume up and oh look ive fast forwarded if i try to go further away from the fast forward trigger area for volume up i pause it you have the rewindfast forward as a single click trigger instead of the original double makes controlling the player a nightmare now : 

input: its a cool app pretty much does everything it needs to do except two things which is beginning to bug me 1 it doesnt scan all medias properly on my device so when i add movies onto my sd card it doesnt show any or it will show some but not all 2 files would randomly disappear from the home page when i just watched them meaning i have to navigate through my folders to find it again even when i play that file again in the folder it still wouldnt go on the home screen pls fix thanks : 

input: im using nokia 81 and before the android 10 upgrade it was working perfectly but after the update im having problems with the screen casting to my tv its cloning the device and the video is playing on both the phone and the tv i want it to play only on tv like it used to before also the stability of the video is messed up because of this please fix this : 

input: very difficult to sync the subtitles if it does not matches with the audio sometimes dont have subtitles some files glitches happen : 

input: earlier version had numbers on equalizer for settings frequency which shows ie 2 1 0 1 2 and so on at bottom while changing frequency up or down on every change in frequency up and down number changes which is not their in new update and it is difficult to set customize equilizar as per fix preset even 0 at middle in equalizer which shows starting point for bottom and up in updated version i am unable to set exact below equalizer in my new phone due to bar or numbers are missing : 

input: i wouldve given 5 stars but the shuffle algorithm sucks it will choose from the same limited number of albums even though i have a few hundred to choose from on my local network and it will play the first song from that album instead of being random sort this out and ill change my rating as i think the sound quality is great on your app : 

input: i was always searching new video app for watching videos bs player gave me long time good playing experience but then their ads now got vlc and deleted all video apps it still has many issues but its better than others : 

input: still the best with the worst icon loads everything more options than most natural file sorting which apparently seems to be too complicated for other players to implement still waiting for that vlc4 on computer tho : 

input: everything is perfectly alright the only problem i am facing is the full characters of any video is not shown in the playlist due to which it is hard to find a video especially in a playlist etc of any course downloaded from youtube : 

input: yes only i use for mp3 player  : 

input: please add short by date option in video view please do this as soon as posibleand please reply me soon : 

input: it gose strate to a blank it no longer works i did love this app but now wtf what happen i wold love to have it back pleeeeeeese : 

input: new update doesnt download some subtitle files : 

input: the updates just make it worse i used to like sorting by date to easily find my latest added files now you can only sort by name i just dont understand how it got less features after an update lots of other small issues with the later versions also im actively looking for a new app as this one doesnt suit all my needs anymore : 

input: i started using vlc since i started to watch moviesearlier in pc nowadays mobile and tab as well i never thought one day i have to reiew this app with less than 5 stars but unfortunately i have to do so now i was so happy when casting option enabled in it and i am still enjoying that feature only thing dissappointed me is that the subtitles are not getting casted to the tv but playing in tv please fix this guys i want to rate this app with 5 star i am using chromecast : 

input: vlc all time favourite player plays all formats been using it for years on pc and now on android will never change it especially with the newish download subtitles feature one problem though with previous version the subtitle delay was not working but with new version it has been fixedbut subtitle download does not work now its a crucial element it never worked again since the updateplz help : 

input: been using it for years on my laptop due to hearing impairment and the fact that it can exceed 100 volume both with and without headphones got it for my phone awhile back and was very very happy however somethings were taken off that kinda upset me 1 the music only area no longer exceeds 100 volume only the video can on phone now and 2 you cannot view a playlists duration anymore if those could be implemented again i would be very very grateful : 

input: subtitle option is problem     : 

input: its is extremely good upto 720p videos but it starts stuttering at 1080p videosmaybe due my device problem redmi y1 audio performance are best i just have one request to add a feature of lyrics in the audio section of the apps : 

input: trying to cast to a a chromecast this is first app that ive used thats actually made using a chromecast painful the app crashes if youre casting another file while one is already playing sometimes it doesnt even manage to connect to the cast device subtitles cant be cast why is that so hard every other media player has supported cast for years : 

input: ive been using the vlc windows application for years its better than any others ive tried this was the reason for choosing this app however the most recent update shrank the tool bar to less than full screen width and removed the ability to refresh the play list after deleting a played file 202002 most recent update doesnt keep place in playback when app is reduced to work on another app : 

input: its good but how do you add other languages in any videos : 

input: its a good player but ive had two problems if i play an audiobook from a url it wont remember where i left off at even if i paused it only five minutes ago downloaded songs to my phone and made a playlist tried to play the playlist amd it only plays a single song over and over tried hitting the next button multiple times and i tried adding each song as next in que still only plays a single song  : 

input: hi before i updated i was able to link my phone screen to the tv and watch as well play with my phone at the same time but now it just links to the tv but my screen is fully seen so if i come off vlc player to go on google that also shows whereas before it just showed the media file that was showing can you bring this feature back please : 

input: before the latest update the player would cast to the tv and the display on phone would turn off while casting nice feature or you could also use you phone it would still cast the content of the player without issuenow however it doesnt you have to leave your display on all the time if you press the home screen the video turns off ive tried all the usual settings ie pip etc but it still doesnt work like it used too can this be resolved please many thanks : 

input: its a real shame what happened to vlc use to work great now every time i start the app it reparces the entire 16 gb mucic collection takes almost 15 minutes before i can listen to the first song making the app pretty much useless : 

input: excllent ive been using vlc player siince its birth on pclaptop up until now : 

input: subtitle in casting is not working : 

input: keeps crashing samsung note 8  : 

input: latest update doesnt work on miphone : 

input: i cant download subtitles anymore : 

input: i am unable to reliably loop playlists i find the icons used for controlling looping all or looping one unintuitive and they arent shown in help files but aside from that it doesnt work : 

input: the casting button is replaced with the resume button even though im not casting anything and im still connected to wifi i tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app and still the casting button not appearing i dont want to dig any deeper into my phone just to delete every trace of vlc just to get the casting option again also have you ever thought that if a tv or chromecast device would lose power while casting fix your damn app : 

input: im using a samsung galaxy a2 and the popup player is not there : 

input: vlc for android just isnt up to the standards of its pc counterpart no matter what android device ive used i always run into some sort of hindrance when playing videos sound cutting out and not reappearing until i exit video cutting out or distorting etc etc it finds a way to ruin anything i watch unfortunately vlc is the only half decent app to support some of the less common video formats so youre forced to deal with its many shortcomings : 

input: i love vlc very much cos it can open almost every file i use it to watch all my videos and movies but this recent update isnt helping me in the previous update am able to download subtitles i do this especially for movies which has foreign language as the main language but in this new update am able to search for subtitles but not able to download pls help : 

input: why i cannot played mp3 format on stream menu : 

input: i have no any problems or issues with this apk : 

input: 20200111 lowered stars from 4 down to 3 on weakness of internet stream interface does not maintain audio track play order when connected to chromecast audio sinks audio tracks randomly start and stop additionally internet stream interface is weak at best other than a uri freeform entry field completely lacking of any userfriendly controls preset just nothing there : 

input: some high resolution videos are not playing on opening the video its saying to use another app called playit i am using this app for long time and i love it but i recently bought an new phone redmi note 8 pro and i downloaded some 4k videos and i tried to play on vlc but when i open it it says use playit app and i have to use that app but dont like it please help me : 

input: i use this for casting to my chromecast it works great but the controls are a bit clunky the controls also disappear after a couple seconds as if youre watching a full screen video which seems a bit pointless in cast mode id like to see it change to more of a remote control during this including skip by 10 seconds etc : 

input: i use this app to connect with my families main computer that has a shared hard drive of movies and shows since this update with the smb authentication i have been unable to connect as no password username combo is working and so has made this app useless to me until its fixed which i hope they do as i still really like vlc as a whole and have been using it since i was a kid : 

input: this app was nice at first but now your update is so bad very annoying what happened to downloading subtitles i can no longer download subtitles this app is lagging seriously you need to work on it : 

input: i am able to have the video im watching replay automatically but if i press the button for the next clipvideo in the playlist to play it instead restarts the current video these two buttons should not interact with each other at all its just redundant when the back to start button already exists : 

input: i cant download subtitle pls fix it : 

input: one of the best video players it just works id like to request a feature grouping videos by their parent directory because the subfolders of different directories sometimes share the same name and the user will be unable to determine which folder does these subfolders belong to for example courses with many levels of subfolders : 

input: lame interface and malfunction prone : 

input: the playlist experience is broken if i change a playlist it doesnt autosave like microsoft groove did so i have to save the playlist again except when i save over the existing playlist it appends the tracks to the existing playlist instead of replacing the original list so i have a playksit of 653 tracks because of that thats not good software design just make playlists automatically save if you remove tracks from them or have saving work like everywhere else in software overwrite : 

input: its good to be a ad free player one goodness aganist all terrible things 1 no exit button 2 if video have inbuilt subs it wont show up i need to download again 3 no option to stop sub title 4subtitle syncing by ourself never happens in vlc 5 everytime i open vlc player it takes 3050sec to load up my files and that toi every single time i open the app all i can find peace is u dont kill user by bombing ads : 

input: with every update vlc becomes more unusable than the previous updates that predated it every video will have an issue such as macro blocking audio suddenly turning off or the video just randomly shutting off trying to cast video to a chromecast will result in maybe if your lucky one to two minutes of play time before the video shuts itself down videolabs should probably just remove their app from the play store since they obviously dont care anymore : 

input: after using the ftp connection on the ios version i am unable to get a connection with the android version blank screen firstly there is no password field unlike the ios port and secondly entering it after the login as usernamexxx xxx does not work either connecting without the password gave no popup requesting it that i was expecting because of the missing field additionally opening the connection profile and clicking ok removes it from the favourites deleting it poor experience : 

input: share move delete folder options missing : 

input: everything is cool but there is one small bug when i lock my device and then unlock it while playing a video the subtitle goes away and i have to select and add the subtitle again manually : 

input: it has gone bit complicated to use the app in the background playlist option was better before next to the tracks and its not saving where i was on the previous video which i was watching i hope it will get fixed : 

input: vlc has since my last review returned to the outstanding mediaplayer i know and love from my computer but in android what has changed is that i no longer can stream videos from youtube i do not know if this is due to the latest vlc update or changes on android whatever it may be i hope the vlc team can get once moreyt stream support on vlc : 

input: ive been using this as my media player of choice for years but a recent update has made the swipe to seek function difficult to use resulting in unintended behaviour for example swiping left near the right hand of the screen either seeks forward or pauses the video and vice versa this worked flawlessly before whats happened : 

input: vlc in all its forms ive had it on windows linux several phones is awesome which is an understatement and a mere review cant really capture the magnitude of my gratefulnes to the developers for having this program and free aswell vlc is free availability vlc supports different platforms cross platform vlc doesnt need extra downloads to support any files you throw at it its actually fun to try and open random files with vlc even something like mkv matroska video format which i know ps3 struggled back in the day and some other programs need codecs for and also phones need extra programs for that often are either shady or no where up to speed vlc is and will always be my choice for a video and audio player audio for pc at least most video players on android just cant keep up : 

input: new update has messed up everything it screwed up the experience that vlc is best media player last update is the worst thing from vlc unable to make playlists many media files does not play which previously play it shows media playback error please release a new update and fix all the issues i believe team vlc will come up with a working solution and fix all design ui app responsiveness library bugs waiting for a update or an option to rollback to previous version : 

input: like a previous update which did the same this recent update wiped all my playlists no music will load into audio list even with directories selected have to load manually from their locations lost my playlists again frustrating also not loading video correctly the past update that had this issue was later fixed so hoping this gets fixed again as well or i might have to stop using altogether will change review ifwhen vlc fixes this issue : 

input: it is crashing multiple times  : 

input: every time when im listening to music then the mucis stop when i lock my phone or listing mucis : 

input: useless after update no cast icon no casting waste of time now : 

input: have this on my laptop and my phone only player i use anymore to watch movies on love it  : 

input: i hate the new updated versioni can no longer play my video while using other apps secondly it keeps closing down without me closing itstopping the music or video playing thirdly if i mute the sound on another game on my phonevlc does not play the sound these things did not happen in the previous versions : 

input: background play i love that background play is an option now seeing that my phones video player doesnt have the best format adaptive capability but the bgp doesnt last long and cuts out randomly back to the screen im using im sure it will get better still a great tool for android : 

input: doesnt support arabic subtitles : 

input: no subtitle when playing casting to tv : 

input: lovly app for android because android mobiles does nt have equalizer options so vlc app is good for music lovers for vlc team i think your app is lovly but you need promote better i dont see much reviews for this lovly app : 

input: i use it on pc but didnt know why i havent used it on my phone until now any way offers all you need thank you team there is an issue though i saved and listen my podcast on vlc by the list doesnt update with new episodes what should i do delete and save again doesnt sound good for me edit cant play youtube videos anymore some still work but most of them dont update i cant play youtube videos anymore can you fix this please : 

input: theres a constant bug whereby everytime i open the app and it starts parsing media the app size grows to more than 2 gigs and keeps growing fix your mess this is a media player not a heavy game like pubg so it doesnt require such large memory occupation fix this cause its annoying : 

input: i love vlc on my pc used to like it on my android phone but it doesnt work on the s10 i hate to give bad reviews but this app just doesnt work even after latest updates movies pauses every 2 seconds doesnt restart time to look for a new video glare for android i would prefer to use vlc once it is fixed : 

input: it would be a whole lot better if i could get music that i have in my you tube playlist transfered over to vlc how can i do that : 

input: how to sync audio for all videos and not just particular video its always out of sync at about 150 ms for me oh and when i strech the video for full screen mode the subtitles are cropped : 

input: super glitchy my videos will not play through : 

input: it still have the same issue of stopping music while playing video as audio after 30 seconds earlier versions did not have this bug but after recent updates this issue came along with it if there would have been no such issue i would have given 5 star ratings cause vlc is the best player for android : 

input: wont play mkv files i love vlc on my computer and have used as long as i can remember i just knew about this app and was i got pretty excited however i cant seem to make it play mkv files i have tried with multiple videos now and only the first frame plays while the audio works fine the files are not corrupted if i transfer them to my pc and use vlc there it works fine the rest of the app is simply amazing as i would expect from vlc anyway i would love to figure this out : 

input: i have been die hard fan vlc for windows but when it comes to android i had used mx player for years not knowingly that vlc is available for android i have been using vlc for android couple of weeks now its just awesome it can smoothly play 720p and 1080p content without breaking sweat where as mx player max out 480p and most importantly no ads at all should have known earlier that vlc exists for android too : 

input: really nice app and no ads     : 

input: need to be able to sort by date added date modified etc until then its hard to give 4 or 5 stars i have to search whole list for something i just added whats worst is i sometimes dont know the name of the file thats added im sorry vlc this should have been a no brainer : 

input: cant get substitle after download update : 

input: no option to play next file automatically in a folder this option is available on the desktop version why isnt it available for android also while on the go accidentally deleted my folder of music when trying to add to playlist just so itd play all songs in the folder damn was that annoying : 

input: unable to get rid of tips pop up every single time on s9 with latest vlc there is always 1 or 2 seconds hiccup at the start with video and audio on bluetooth this does does happen on other apps : 

input: cant dl subtitle anymore       : 

input: okay the app for android working on a fire tablet hd10 cannot play any of the files were they be mp3 or windows media audio i have not had this issue with the pc version running windows 10 and 7 i actually used a different program called windows media audio player and it found every file and was able to play them with no problem also im installing the app had to do it through the tablet listing for apps as would not uninstall from the place tour : 

input: has become confusing eg if opening in audio file from a file manager it plays it in the background and i have to open vlc from the status bar and i cant change that behaviour but once i got it set up and as long as i start in vlc itself its pretty good : 

input: i use it to listen to music and its good for the most part only problem is with the latest update when i installed it it wont let me play over 600 songs i downloaded i either have to play the songs directly from the directories section or use a different app aside from that its a great app : 

input: waste app sometimes there will be so many glitches in the app and cant play the video videos will be shown doubleoriginal glithed as mx player is better than this but there will be unwanted features in it like whattsaap status download movies online but there is no glitches in it but here calci it will be so many glitches when we refreshed the videos it will slowly search the internal media : 

input: not useable since the new update i cant even delete a file only 3 options are available if i click on a video play append add to playlist thats it not ok attention do not install since the newest update it got worse now this app deletes files without permission got a few files deleted : 

input: no external audio track option : 

input: my tv just updated to the latest 326 version now when set to android tv ui app will exit when opening any browsing option internal network favourites etc etc seems to work fine in normal ui mode just more difficult to use and seems to have lost file skip functionality : 

input: this is the swiss army knife for android fire and pc 1it plays every av file type 2it speeds up talkies with minimal artifacts 3it slows down music without changing the key and with minimal artifacts 4hotkeys on pc are useful open source is the future meritocracy scientific method and free speech is a successful future corruption isnt the new to humankind jesus experiment can work : 

input: ive had zero problems with vlc it does everything plays everything it streams you can play movies as audio only so u can turn off the screen and fall to sleep listening to a movie pop up player is adjustable i dont get why anyone would rate this less than maybe 4 stars tbh : 

input: is not showing subtitles the app is bad : 

input: one bug i found is that if you pause a video and press the home button then goto recent apps and click on vlc back vlc minimises itself instead of showing the paused video : 

input: glad to have the delete option back seems now the app has a problem keeping the filenames straight simply refreshing doesnt help when i delete a file the name is apparently assigned to a remaining file i can only tell what the real filename is by looking at the information : 

input: faff to get music into library from my pc had to do some stupid steps manually copying over and sharing each file with the app why it cant be like good old days ill never know just let me open my fing phone internal storage put on a sodding folder of mp3s and then bloodly look there why is it so hard to do anything like this when it should be ridiculously simple ffs : 

input: i updated the app 2 days agoi regret my decision as i cant use it anymore because it keeps crashing now : 

input: so i finally used vlc today to test it i only have one request if i put my music videos and audios in one place i need them to play that folder like a normal playlistthat is i can play an audio file and click next to play a video file with no problems like mx if you implement this i will be your fan for life that is why i give a 4 star othewise good player with no ads : 

input: why in the ever loving would you give the option of deleting entire storage locations from within the app i was trying to remove my internal storage from the directory so the app would not detect files from it only the sd card using the delete option only to find out that it literally deleted everything on the phone mediawise poofa thousand priceless photos gone : 

input: cant cast to a chromecast for longer than 10 minutes before it gets confused and tries to load something entirely different than what i was playing but really just freezes and stops casting : 

input: only thing i use for media on android and windows : 

input: when selecting a subtitle from the search results its not showing but the subtitle download seams to be succesful according the ui feedback please make more test about it : 

input: crash sometimes during movie play on minix u9h android 7 : 

input: subtitle not showing up        : 

input: decent but have usability problems 1 the app force refresh the folder content at same time when user is selecting what he want that is very annoying and caus a lot of lag : 

input: problem on having it to fit screen it just only zoomed the video can you fix this i have some videos on sd and when i resize it to best fit or others except the fit screen it have a big border well on 720p it have no problem wheb just having it on center just fix the fit screen thats all that i asked before i uninstall and find other application : 

input: the position of the subtitles should be independant of what the video size is like when i set the video to fit screen the subtitles go below the screen and only partially visible is there any option to change the position of the subtitles cause if not maybe it would be a good thing : 

input: decent player but the android auto side of the app needs a lot of work biggest thing is that media rarely ever resumes when you launch the app in aa this usually means i have to launch the app on the phone to resume playback really need to add resume button in aa like there is in the app : 

input: it stops chromecasting         : 

input: impossible not to give 5 stars i use it on all my devices : 

input: damn guys i dont know what you did bit i hope you can undo it mi vlc was working just fine now it doesnt shows all my videos cant sort them by size video suddenly stops to rescan libraries all kind of troubles it didnt had in the previous version i hope you can fix it because this is still my choice of media player edit still trash : 

input: great program i have been having an issue with using the repeat feature when i repeat 1 song it always seems to turn ab repeat on and starts from the point in the song that i actually turned on repeat it is very irritating because i cant just repeat the song : 

input: great app but had to uninstall and rate lower will not stop autoplaying audio files when i get into my car annoying beyond belief and cannot find any settings to disable this behavior please assist and i will adjust my rating accordingly for this otherwise perfect app : 

input: i only use it to cast content to my chromecast but the cast button just disappeared after using it one time tried everything reinstalling clear cache clear data tried different wifi networks and yes my phone an the chromecast are on the same wifi please just fix the damn button using local cast for now and not vlc until they fix it : 

input: there seem to be some issues with the subtitles in the latest update it does not appear at the bottom but instead it is positioned at 14 of the screen there are also artifacts around the subtitles that makes it annoying to read : 

input: does not working on my samsung a2 core anymore : 

input: worka great no issues          : 

input: the fix stopped vlc from loading any videos on my android device vlc says all directories are empty they are not it was working good before the fix now i have to search for the file i want to watch then select vlc to play it not good : 

input: the best video player no issues until now and i love the pc version of it as well i appreciate they dont have ads : 

input: the subtitles does not cast    : 

input: i love vlc i have it on my computer as well however i find it absolutely ridiculous that it deletes my playlists randomly it did it a couple of times now so i wont risk putting the time into creating the playlists again looking for another player : 

input: crashes alot while casting to smart tv : 

input: plays in the background again sorry for being pissy would be not nice to have autoplay other than that good on ya : 

input: adjusting the subtitles in settings wont work having tried adjusting their size color adding background making them bold but none worked they just stayed the same all the time : 

input: the best media player i even managed to wire it to discord to play every single video without downloading it and with minimal buffering wonderful : 

input: i love the app i use it on every device and pc i have the latest update doesnt show my videos or saved playlists i have over 300 videos on my device and i can only see 12 audio does not show up at all please fix this still exists in the latest update samsung galaxy note 9 : 

input: the app used to work fine now it doesnt load the videos right if i delete a video the title of the video is still there but when i click it goes to another video even refreshing the screen or reopening the app this issue is still there : 

input: the app is behaving oddly from past few days and not working as per actions done swiping left isnt rewinding the scene and swiping forward is forwarding way too much content in one go have updated it but no use using huawei mate 10 lite from more then a year didnt received such issue previously : 

input: very few oversights top grade app : 

input: this update sucks i want the old version back when ever i want to increase or decrease the volume by sliding on screen it always skip the video 10 secs and the second thing is that when i skip the video by double tap on screen it pauses the video at the same time plz fix this problem as soon as possible : 

input: cannot add subtitle why        : 

input: come on my review is been up for more than a month and u havent fixed the issue my chromecast use my phone hotspot as a wifi device i can cast any apps from my phone but the vlc player the only app casting options is not showing pls fix this and add an option to go for next video while casting by either automatic or manual tq : 

input: i use it to play voicemail files because its the only app i know of that can play the files one thing i absolutely hate about it is that it takes over my bluetooth media and its like pulling teeth to get it to give control to my google play music again : 

input: currently buggy it pauses the video each time i seek sometimes it doesnt most of the time it does really annoying compared to the old versions : 

input: not liking the overhaul the new vlc has less options a worse ui no option for grid view resume last playlist doesnt work lost all previously saved playlists no sort by date or last played i am very disappointed with the 2nd to most recent vlc update and that they have released an additional update without fixing this further disappoints me update still not fixed down to 1 star : 

input: this is so goddamn worst app you guys even cant do normal support of this app casting from this app really worst experience icon cast from time to time just despairing and you are not able to cast videos from your smartphone to tv thank you so much for showing which app its better to not use : 

input: best but when you watch video in landscape mode the quality of video will drop like 720p to 480p : 

input: hevc 265 file not work properly it takes 20 charging of 1 hr video please fix this problem whenever hevc 264 file takes 2 or 3 charge of 1 hr video : 

input: not that great with synonyms subtitles syncing : 

input: the update wont open now i have to uninstall it and reinstall the older version i dont have time for this : 

input: ever since the new update its terrible the new design looks bad sometimes tapping once when a video is play stops it other times it shows the controls whenever i add new videos it cant find them or mislabeles them until i restart the app : 

input: after last update there is problem with resume of playing audio i have an audiobook and when i pause it and try to resume it it starts from beggining after that i must search where i pause it but it is one of my favourite player : 

input: i hav always know and preferred this app to others becos its compatible with most if not all video formatsi guess it was all a fluke recently it stops pic and keeps playing audio and wont be corrected till i found i cud correct it by restarting my phone shame : 

input: ive messed around with the pc version for about 15 years its always been ok but on android i find it doesnt transfer my music from over from windows 10 without all the track 1s on each album being put in unknown artist on vlc android using a p30pro its really annoying so i have to look for new music player and rate 2  : 

input: ok in regards to opening media content awesome however the app doesnt resume play from where paused therefore everytime you stop you have to figure out where you were ugh frustrating if you listen while working or somewhere you have interruptions : 

input: great app open source no ads and plays everything however it should have the simple ability to rewind and fast forward by a set time say 30 seconds using the slider is impossible to do this : 

input: nice app but streaming option is very bad : 

input: i cant download a substitle of a movie : 

input: 1 aspect ratio not working in android tv 2 sometime playing movie suddenly getting green screen 3 local network tab click and right side ui getting issue 4 audio song play using chrome cast not working properly skip songs automatically and sometimes get loading the song : 

input: the subtitles wont download gave full permission for storage access still not saving or loading everything else in the app works well : 

input: one of the best apps i have ever used however last time i updated it the app stopped downloading subtitles please do fix this bug : 

input: my main use for vlc is to cast my videos to my chromecast it is very buggy and frustrating to use the main presentation of your videos is also very frustrating with some videos grouped into folders while others will be just lined up one after the other : 

input: 1080p mkv videos not playing properly : 

input: subtitles doesnt work well     : 

input: sometimes after pause it goes to start : 

input: you should put date option latest to oldest vise versa when sorting also put new sticker when it is new more thumbnail columns on grid view not only 2 eg x4 x6 x8 i hope we can delete directly on the app it is also lagging on 1080p videos waiting for your fast action : 

input: not working properly if the app is not updated : 

input: love it i kindly request to add total queue play time and remove everything from queue before after certain queue item features 3 : 

input: online subtitle search not workingalso there is a very bad synchronisation with downloaded subtitlei have to everytime manually do iton other video player same working finelast play video should be automatically play if i click bottom play button but not working android vlc not great as pc version : 

input: the app worked great at first but its kinda malfunctioning now it stops before i even get a change to play a video i cant use it for a damn thing : 

input: the one thing missing from this app is the ability to sort files by modified date i really think that this would make the app perfect the rationale is a lot of times and you have new files you want them at the top because thats what you want to watch : 

input: not good at all try and work on it again lacking features such as you cant search for subtitles online songs keep repeating itself where it stoped : 

input: thumbnails dont always update correctly library doesnt always appear requires data to be cleared subtitles dont always appear love the ui but the actual video player needs a lot of fixing : 

input: subs are turning off by itself : 

input: very bad not usable for chrome os pip doesnt work still very glitchy and horrible vlc used to work just fine a year ago stop messing with it : 

input: i love using vlc to play music audios but just after the last update i cant seem to play music via bluetooth using the app : 

input: lost casting icon on android 9 box since update so disapointed : 

input: the interface is loading slow  : 

input: is from better to worse its no longer playing all the videos that bad you are failing to deliver better development next time im replacing it with something better : 

input: new vlc update is worst and previous vlc is more awesome : 

input: we cant download the subtitles fix this : 

input: loading is the main problem in this apk : 

input: there is a bug on the new version when the button bar is hidden for a few minutes it will dissapear pressing the screen wont make it pop up anymore this problem doesnt occur if i enable double tap to seek : 

input: earlier this app was at the best version but somehow after the update the casting icon disappeared i dont know how but i tried uninstalling and then again installing the app then too the casting icon is not there now i am unable to cast my content to my smart tv : 

input: it doesnt work that well for example many of the times i click on a file using the file manager vlc does not start play anything at all also after having chosen to open the file with vlc : 

input: im on nokia 7 plus and android 10 recently i noticed that the app doesnt change the brightness it shows the percentage going up or down as i try to change the brightness but in reality nothing happens and i have to change the brightness out of the app : 

input: i give it a 4 still needs work in areas but the biggest thing i happy it plays example 100 out 100 files unlike all other players only play 50 out 100 : 

input: never stops running in backup cant shut off too bad used to be my fav but now theres better that offer to close when exiting app : 

input: can not cast video with subtitle : 

input: mkv videos have no audio       : 

input: i cant to download subtitle by vlc : 

input: hey the subtitle download isnt working for a few months nowtried on multiple deviceshope it gets fixed soon : 

input: why the heck would the developers place previous pause and next buttons right next to each other and leave so much space on either side many times ive skipped to the next song when all i wanted to do is pause play : 

input: garbage app keeps going through media folders even though you uncheck the option to automatically scan it heats up the phone and takes forever when you have a large sd card : 

input: ive used vlc for pc for about a decade with barely any issues but for the android constant there are some very annoying bugs happening with this particular app one of them messing with my playlists and forgetting them entirelyfix please thank you : 

input: after android 10 update app is not working it crashing and gets stuck on parsing media remote playback is crashing update it for android 10 : 

input: does not allow the sizing of the screen when in screen mirroring mode it is annoying when the video size is larger in the tv and its cropped so you cant see a rather large part of the actual screen : 

input: there is some bug in search play it is not playing the searched video instead it is planning the video visible before at the same place please correct the bug make our favourite video player perfect again im running this application on android 81 : 

input: plays everything you throw at it difficult to play pause a stream the notification control dont work and sometimes i have to force close the app to stop it it also doesnt respond to bluetooth controls for playpause : 

input: come on yaar there is no subtitles in any movie it is not showing any subtitle even after download externally just recorrect your coding this is happening from last update : 

input: it crash when i trun my phone screen off and on and also when i minimise the app and try reopen please fix those problems not me every body review this problems : 

input: plays videos other players cant : 

input: the labeltitle of the files in vlc are moving horizontally which is sooooo friggin unnecessary doesnt make any sense doing that cause it just makes it harder to locate a file for you have to wait for the words to stop moving like seriously what is that for annoying af : 

input: could be better for continuing where you left off doesnt always show progress on the episode list stupid navigation tips stay over the video until you click on the screen to dismiss instead of going away after a time : 

input: music player sometimes makes audiomusic stutter it happens regardless of whether you are using earphones or not it mostly happens when i am listening to music and the phone is locked and rarely when it is on : 

input: i was enjoying this app up until this recent new update since the update everything has been useless my video dont resume from where i left off the auto resume button doesnt respond anymore and my watched video mark no longer exist pls fix all these or youre going to lose usersffs : 

input: subtitles error since last update : 

input: screen cast has stopped working it says file path missing or something like that but it works fine on other players come on guys you are one of the best media player out there i dont know how many more people are facing this issue : 

input: best video player without any ads unlike mx player : 

input: only sort by name isnt sort by date the most used and why is the overlay for brightness and volume change so big its as bad as the old ios : 

input: no issues at all my wish i cant wait until vlc makes it possible to watch a movievideo in my truck via android auto : 

input: i waslooking for an app that can play the video that i want and after 6 app i download this app and this is the only one wich is working : 

input: great love it because no adds and no other extra useless content just serving its purpose i have observed an issue and that is subtitles are not downloading please fix the issue in next update : 

input: there is no option to disable fastforwarding and rewinding with gestures this leads to the user often skipping through the video even if the only intention was to change the volume or brightness : 

input: ive always used vlc from the start if theres been any problems theyve been rectified quickly ever reliable i would love to have a button on the widget to save songs as the are played to a custom playlist : 

input: hate the new update display before update had side by side thumbnails to scroll down through now has one long row of thumbnails i have to scroll all the way down to find music i want much slower restore former display and i give you five stars again : 

input: theres no marker sign on video that i have watched i should know how long duration that i have watched of each movie on video lists sometimes video cant continue from last minute that i have watched i cant remember every movie that i have not finished i need a clue marker sign : 

input: tried this app on my samsung galaxy s10 plus and i didnt care for it too much the volume is low plus it wouldnt let me pick what to have in my folders its all or nothing so im sorry but going to have to uninstall : 

input: great app for playing video files on android although the latest update seems to have glitched the subtitle searchdisplay features resuming a video file seems to be hit or miss is about my only complaint : 

input: vlc is really good video player but the main fault they remove few important things in an update in the new update they have removed the sort out by date option i seriously couldnt differentiate between new video the old onetry to make it work better then other video players not to make it worse vlcforandroid : 

input: does its job like on pc wish there would be a converter just like the pc : 

input: buggy and unstable whenever i open some other app it forgets where i was and starts the video from the beginning : 

input: subtitles download not working : 

input: i love the 200 volume since there are movies and videos that have low volume : 

input: it really pathetic application its not open properly showing icon only dont waste your time guys dont download it : 

input: it have sound limite and that why i like it : 

input: the subtitles is not working   : 

input: good app but the new version doesnt group videos : 

input: very nice apps for playing video but this last update is filled with bugs minimize pause or the light of your screen went off then you will need to start playing all over from your phone file manager the vlc apps will be closed fixed this bugs : 

input: what happened to vlc before it was one of the best media players out there now it wont even scan my media folder properly and new videos copied on my storage wont show on the videos list thats sad : 

input: my experience with this app has been so outstanding but i havent been really impressed with the subtitle issues i watch most hindi movies on the app without them being subtitled i only understand the movies via actions of the actors and actresses and its so frustrating : 

input: devs still meddling and screwing everything up completely messed the aspect ratio display is incorrect on phone and tablet and resize doesnt help chromecast is okay so issue is just with app rendering unable to use 2 stars off if it aint broken dont fix it ffs : 

input: but in this app must not be shows share option how to share videos from vlc media player but mx player may be share videos but it wasnt convenient to my purpose because contains add but this app awesome and plz update new version to share videos option : 

input: all of a sudden it wont load anymore too bad uninstalled : 

input: draining battery please fix this : 

input: version 326 slows the movie playing the tapping for 10 seconds fast seeking shows an annoying ugly shape which covers one fifth of the movie screen making its hard to watch the movie i do not recommend upgrading to version 326 : 

input: when i press the button to download subtitles it just keeps loading and it never downloads this is continuous problem please fix this : 

input: perfect best player without add : 

input: another app that separates songs from the album not sure what is going on with these apps but does a few most and they all do the same thing even to open them in folder format justs doesnt work anyones know an app that opens albums and just plays : 

input: always scans for media when connected to bluetooth auto scans are off but still does it tried clearing cache and reinstalling but still does it : 

input: dowload a subtitle is no longer working : 

input: i cant download any subtitle files on the download subtitle section even if i am manually downlaoding it it sucks that i need to download other srt fikes from other websites than vlc itself : 

input: useless worst experience crashes all the time and subtitles are on another level goodbye my little friend swithching to max player : 

input: thank you devs you guys just broke the best player on android this thing unusable right now used to be easy to set substitle and casting now when trying to select substitle files it keeps using the url directory uninstalled : 

input: does its job some features missing or maybe just well hidden like a mark as played button cant complain too much though its free : 

input: used to be a brilliant app until version 326 messed around with the layout now naming playlists comes up where my navigation buttons are so i cant add playlists get it back in the middle of the screen : 

input: something is wrong with the ab repeat if i close the ap while playing it as audio it will be stuck in a random ab loop tapping a b doesnt cancel the loop closing and reopening the player doesnt cancel the loop : 

input: its giving error on playing videos : 

input: error on subtitle manual search : 

input: used it on another device years ago brilliant app : 

input: on some of my shows it starts glitching when things get heated : 

input: please add icecast station list like vlc desktop : 

input: best player for android but there is a problem while casting subtitles doesnt appear on tv : 

input: dont like the new menu since the 122319 upgrade wish it has one frame advance and save frame as jpg feature plays most movie files it is pretty good for the most part it came with the phone : 

input: used to be the best player about but its now stopped working on android 9 files are there but will no longer display any listing it just displays all folders as being empty : 

input: this app is on of the best app than mx playeri love this appi love vlc app this app work well on my slow mobileso i love it mx playe doesnt work well on mobile so i hat mx player and i love vlc vedio appfor android i love this app creator : 

input: my video played as audio keeps stopping all the time i did disable battery optimisation really cant figure out why the video keeps stopping after some time i then need to pull out my phone and press play again : 

input: its not that comfortable and need to improve alot : 

input: when i go to home and return back to vlc video plaer its not working : 

input: i cant download subtitles      : 

input: not working in one plus 7t pro hahaha such a local app i hav ever seen : 

input: better from the start but after updating to newer version i wasnt able to download subtitles again nonsense i think i will look for better video player : 

input: names of albums and songs text runs impossible to locate what i am looking for found a good alternative to vlc : 

input: updates shouldnt remove functionality but they did and wat were they thinking making longer filenames tiles scroll i can hardly read episode name or number anymore as one of them is constantly off screen and ofc no setting to disable something like that : 

input: everything is good but they should imrove audio player interface it cannot change track by audio player automatically i have to change it manuall so plzzz look after it : 

input: app does not open after moved to sd card : 

input: would love to give the app 5 stars but the lack of pinch to zoom is a major drawback considering that gesture has been around 10 or 15 years i was quite shocked that such a well known and respected video player does not support it : 

input: this works well but there is no obvious way to save the address to an rtsp stream so you have to enter it in every time even keeping a history of the last 5 or 10 streams would be useful : 

input: ability to play videos not generaly suported by android seven stars sneek permissions that acess cellular data that can also be used to spy on u i give 3 stars for cyber security risk assesments because of sneek permission that acess cellular data permissions in background newer versions of android os you can disable this in settings but you really have to look to find it vlc was sort of sneeky as for all other permissions it lets you know whats its doing asks but not background data : 

input: ever since the update the videos cannot properly fit on my screen before just offer an option for a rollback or fix with the next update very soon it is extremely boring : 

input: why vlc stopped the webm format video fix it : 

input: really unintuitive adding files to playlists is awful you tap on the playlist name and it transfers the name down at the bottom as if to create a new playlist and no indicator anything has happened terrible ui : 

input: love vlc however the google chromebook i have is not working well with this version of the product i find this to be more of a google issue as vlc has always been dependable for me : 

input: moved from mx player cos of the ads im so impressed never going back : 

input: its a great app but i used to be able to download subtitles but after updating the app i no longer can i dont know whats wrong : 

input: it best for watching movies because the volume goes up to 200 but for music too it should be up to 200 : 

input: i apologize for the unnecessary complaint l actually left my music in repeat mode that resulted to the repetition of the same song over and over again i am sorry once again so fams out there who has one complain or another check well if you are not the cause thank you : 

input: totally awesome 1 if you dont have subtitle you just can download it from vlc : 

input: automaticly starts on the phone stating loading : 

input: great app used it for years but for some reason it fails to update when new videos are available sometimes stating no media was found when i can find it in the default video player : 

input: great app unfortunately i am experiencing frequent crashes when searching songs there is a 30 in 100 chance that it will crash when i press the search button : 

input: the app has showing false thumblines for example it tak e thumblines from other songs pls fix it and no other major issues really good app : 

input: latest update kills my music while its playing i have to manually go into the app to restart done this about 8 times or so already : 

input: your latest update makes my phone freeze s7edge when using the popup player please fix this issue : 

input: using vlc since agesi trust therefore : 

input: did last update and not working the full screen with one touch icon for full screen and you phone goes on black mode but now you see it on your phone and tv at the same time please fix this it was a 5 star app : 

input: best app for playerhope u just make an update that would allow users to add songs by clicking on the playlist instead of clicking the song one by one just to add each song to a certain playlistcos its kinda a hassle especially if u have tons of songs : 

input: wish there was an option for this not to pause on game adds and the like unnecessary and inconvenient still a great media player app but holds it back from earning 5 stars in my opinion : 

input: the latest update has honestly turn vlc into one of the worst video players ever and vlc used to be the best what the hell are you doing vlc developers just delete the update and roll it back to how it was : 

input: im not able to play web dl x265mkv format on my phone : 

input: not sure if its a new update causing the problem but with no media apps open if i press play on a headset the last thing i had playing in vlc starts playing happens after a reboot even annoying : 

input: the only player ive used that has reliably played every video ive put up o against it : 

input: my songs start from the middle i hate it and i always have to reopen the app and set them from the start how do i fix this already reinstalled already cleared cache : 

input: subtitles are not working      : 

input: this app was great until the past couple of months the cast button no longer appears its the one reason i got it for android im sad because i love vlc : 

input: this app sucks it doesnt support any kind of audio format its a total wastage : 

input: please tell me why subtitle is not working in my android phone i know how to add it but it is not showing even if i enable the subs and yes it is srt file : 

input: it no longer works for me which is unfortunate because i use to love this app it will not even open now : 

input: great for playing locally on my phone but the cast is messed up will play for random amount of times but cut out unexpectedly head wrecking but the same with all cast apps so not singing vlc out great app except for this : 

input: buggy and unstable to the point of being useless it will play a file the first time and then after that when i try to play a file the little player bar will just crash immediately : 

input: vlc should not start just because i turned on bluetooth vlc should not scan for media files every time it is started or every time vlc is given focus vlc should not scan for media files after i have turned auto rescan off : 

input: the video and audio quality is fine but all the videos are incorrectly labelled which is very irritating and time consuming : 

input: i cant play network streamsearlier it was playing okwhile i can play those same on some other available players : 

input: always clones while casting after recent update this significantly reduces usefulness as i am unable to view video content on my tv in full screen and continue to use other apps on my device : 

input: would have given 5 stars if the subtitle function has not stopped working please repair the subtitle function otherwise it is the perfect app : 

input: lock screen fastest forwerd and back smoth display : 

input: wont play more than 1 song without stopping no matter what i do desktop version is awesome android version is garbage how dare you call this vlc that name used to mean something : 

input: audio quality not good in android 10 at same time other video players work well cutting out audio in vlc player only what i hear is the background music just like karaoke of songs please fix : 

input: its a great app i have been using it for years the recent update is problematic cause when ever the screen turns off the app also stops playing any help on that regard : 

input: i would have given a 5star rating but unfortunately i cannot play mkv files on this app please improve this : 

input: speed button required on display : 

input: audio not available            : 

input: i still cant download any subtitles whenever i search it brings results but when i click on any it just doesnt download please fix it or ill have to delete it : 

input: really good app but since the last update may be the search and play option is not working properly : 

input: i can not for the life of me get subs to load i have been using this app and its been working fine for the last year and i have the srt files but it simply will not display : 

input: what happened to audio delay no way to sync audio to video to cover bluetooth speaker latency it was just there a few days agonow theres no sign of where to make the adjustment : 

input: it wouldnt let me play any link and even if it did it would only be for a few minutes before kicking me out of it and saying that it cant play what im trying to play : 

input: pretty good appit works perfectly exept when i use it to cast a movie into chromecast and ive selected a caption the caption wont work on the tvplease help xd : 

input: small improvement needed i updated my phone to android q recently and i found it was a problem when returning to video list menu from playing a video because of no return button on the top of left : 

input: i liked the new ui and all the other features other than that there is a problem it doesnt show the contents of my sd card external storage even when i have ticked to show the contents of sd card option plz fix this : 

input: no next and back button always back to start when you pause sa video :

input: god damn fix your subtitle downloader been waiting for its stability from such a long time just make it work smoothly : 

input: the weird thing right now is that it doesnt support hdr playback videos i have a device that is capable of displaying hdr contents yet this video player cant permit that : 

input: just shifted from mx player it would be nice if it had a button which could continue a video were i left last time main function of continuously playing videos in linear order is missing : 

input: it stops casting on the tv lately it simply disappears out of nowhere as if i closed the app whats the matter mind that i have excluded it from battery optimization : 

input: still seems to struggle with gapless playback otherwise very nice :

input: for some reason its just crashes after the update just blank screen : 

input: good app but ready bad when it comes to the streaming keeps on disconnected during movies like every 20 mins it use to be good but not anymore : 

input: works with most videos subtitles never work because vlc doesnt code them in cast videos stop by themselves before they are finished this is terribly annoying : 

input: excellent app only problem is that it doesnt play the next track automatically after previous track is finished :

input: its is a good app to save my downloaded movies but it has a flaws which is when the video is playing and i go to homepage of my phone and when i click the play video the sound was not there :

input: it cannot save credentials for my nas even though i have clicked on save password it keeps asking for credentials after i click on login and wont let me access filesdirectories on my nas with smb shares : 

input: ive been a user of vlc for android for as long as i can remember however i recently noticed that i can search for subtitles but im unable to download them is there a chance this could be fixed :

input: if i could give vlc for android negative rating i would i installed this 2 days ago and it still isnt showing any of the videos on my phone in its library every time i try to update the library the app stops working never once has my k20 pro hanged in the last 6 months ive been using it but it does every time i try to open vlc if the app opens then it stops working while updating the library i havent been able to play a single video in 2 days since i installed vlc :

input: ive encountered a bug with a few particular yet quite normal mp3 files from my music library every time they play vlc locks my phone after unlocking it the phone immediately goes locked again and so on as long as those files are playing the only way to stop it is to stop the playback from the lock screen :

input: subtitles aint downloading idk why do something about this : 

input: keeps asking for password for smb share its sub folders and files : 

input: one of the problems that im facing is when i click on a video back and forward buttons dont appear to get to the next videos and only play that 1 video but when i click the play button for each folder back and forward button appear can make this possible clicking on the folder play button then playlist is annoying because videos are much smaller and i need to always start on the 1st video its also easy to miss the right video in playlist compare to normal folder view : 

input: it is terrible on my samgalj5 it shows the available video on my device but when i click on the video vlc plays a song whenever i delete a music from my device vlc shows it in its album and when i click to play itwhich has been deleted it shows an error and again plays a new song which was not my order i think vlc likes my songs badly i cant change position of subtitle orientation does not change when i tap on otientation bottomwhat happend to u menwhats wrong with u tnx : 

input: didnt like the new ui in the beta : 

input: i like it it plays my gallery videos also i rated i 4 stars because i dont like the vlc no media picture it is scary : 

input: play pause botton is under my home button : 

input: i dont know why but this app doesnt let me use the scrubber bar at the bottom to jump to a different section while playing an audio or video file it just resets the videoaudio back to 000 when ever touched is that not a basic part of a media players functionality this is very irritating but otherwise a very good functioning app with 0 adds and a simplistic layout : 

input: very bad experiance about files reading it doent work  : 

input: subtitles still dont work when casting to chromecast : 

input: best of all android media players but i m not sure if it is a trusted app : 

input: it works its free no spam love it : 

input: thnx to vlc im able to play 10bit x265h even mx player pro failed to : 

input: it very good but we should be able to send multiple video true de apps :

input: app will not play videos from youtube i try to stream : 

input: weird this app is so laggy and slow respond on my phone : 

input: opens every video and audio but is a bit confusing like most other video and audio apps you see many many audio and video files i think it needs a part to show only selected files logo is confusing some people think its about driving and its not beautiful even in desktop recently i didnt install it at desktop just because of logo : 

input: stream option not working for me  : 

input: playback history do not work for me i can not turn off it  : 

input: no independent app volume no multiple instances : 

input: unable to download lyrics      :

input: i didnt have any access when regards to watch a video mtv music in hd it cannot play why : 

input: subtitles doesnt work with chromecast : 

input: poor sound sometimes           : 

input: its not working on my samsung a2 : 

input: cant skip videos               : 

input: why i cant share my music      : 

input: good but since last update its more awkward to use : 

input: audio gira off after 2 min of streaming : 

input: after update i cant download subtitle please fix it : 

input: even with no permission and the app killed in the background it still plays music : 

input: widget gone i used that every day bring back the widget : 

input: bad not running bluray file    : 

input: a song cannot be repeated when you play a song from a folder on files apps you need to open the app and go through thousands of songs to get to the one you want the search option dont show songs either thats the only way you can repeat a song : 

input: subtitle dont download         : 

input: sharing option is not available  : 

input: vlsub wont download subtitles it performs the search and finds the subtitles just fine but when i select a subtitle file and click download nothing happens it used to work for me ive used it bunches before but now it just stopped working and theres not even an error message or anything just nothing happens : 

input: not discovering any hidden videos and file videos its dissapointing : 

input: i love the app but thier is a bug on the latest update : 

input: crash problem after recent update : 

input: vlc on pc has been going downhill for a decade now and the mobile version is no exception random glitches like videos playing as audio with the firstframe thumbnail as the video feed constantly losing its place in longer playlists all these simple functions that videolan used to excel at that have been suffocated by feature creep being crammed down its throat makes me wistful of the noncellshaded traffic cone icon of the early 2000s : 

input: subtitles are not downloading  : 

input: subtitles are not being displayed : 

input: this update is worst because song name is running any time could not find my favour song : 

input: after this update this app jst became trash now i cant play any songs videos from my sd card except i go to the vlc app and select it like whats hapening guys since i bought my phone i dont think ive used any player apart from vlc 3years and counting but nowi have to find another app tha can actually do what its supossed too pls fix plssssss : 

input: doesnt sort my video right bad updates : 

input: wouldnt stop glitching i set it to lock in landscape but every time id tap the screen to bring up playback controls it would just switch to portrait mode instead of bringing up controls if it werent for this i mightve ditched kodi for vlc but that really ruined the experience for me to not even be able to watch or control video playback correctly : 

input: why does videos now pause when we seek change it back : 

input: google cast not properly work  : 

input: work on the equalizer otherwise perfect : 

input: im using this player from a decade this is the worst update ever i have seen : 

input: awesom i was not able to play my downloaded music but after installing this app it open all my music n i listen to them all : 

input: great but i still prefer mx player pro reason because mx player pro gives us the option to enable the ability for the player to ignore nomedia files so we can see videos like video ads that are downloaded by apps that are ad supported with that feature we can delete all the video ads and free up a whole lot of space i only downloaded vlc today because i havent used it in years : 

input: ads that took control of my tablet : 

input: nice app but lack of next previous button : 

input: cannot play midi also annoyingly stops itself from a playlist if theres a file it cannot play rather than skip it it needing to scan new files seems to freeze sometimes too of which it scanning to begin with annoys me the only real nice feature is it being able to play videos in the background even with the screen off : 

input: i have limited access to internet explorer and need to get help resolving this matter : 

input: i am writing this review for the android tv version of this app it has one problem that it does not read ntfs format partition on external hdd attached to android smart tv via usb it reads and plays videos from fat32 partition on external hdd i request the developer team to look into this issue of they can solve it in next few updates : 

input: doesnt cast all the time and is buggy : 

input: so i dont like when begin the first song of playlist when i go to the other app or block my cellphone : 

input: i am not able to find cast option in oneplus 5 : 

input: bad last update not working anymore useless : 

input: my vlc was just fine until i updated it last night and things went awry once the popup recedes the screen goes off with it and the audio keeps playing so it is impossible to use as i cannot keep tapping the screen to keep it on also the new interface is very difficult to understand not to mention ugly : 

input: subtitle not playing while using crom cast : 

input: i cant download subtitles it is always telling me that there is an error and i should try again in a few seconds i keep on trying but there is no improvement seriously the previous versions are better than this new one : 

input: failed to login to smb v3 server : 

input: no ads and free                : 

input: theres no jump to next video button  : 

input: not operate smoothly suddenly close without reason : 

input: still not fixed many bugs      : 

input: app is impossible to download since google screwed up play store with wifi idiots : 

input: i downloaded subtitles for specific movie and it was working perfectly and whenever i close the application and open it later it continues the movie but without subtitles the whole process of having to search for subtitles again is a kiiler problem please fix this would you : 

input: plays every type of media files loved this app :

input: when delete some audio file automatically app closed very bad experience please solve plz sve my issue : 

input: its having problems playing videos well : 

input: good but mx player is best     : 

input: this app is fantastic new update is great except now when i go into details of either an album or a playlist it no longer tells me how long said playlist is anymore also the new equalizer doesnt tell you what dbs youve set each level at anymore it is not ideal at all please consider changing i miss these features a lot : 

input: subtitles dont work on chromecast :

input: i use this app about 2 months it is better than mx player : 

input: no casting option              : 

input: this used to be the best plays any video format fast subtitle download and all that but the recent updates did more harm than good : 

input: definitely would like to see a rewind 30 seconds feature its incredibly tedious as it stands now to rewind an audiobook or video if you miss something : 

input: wonderful app the best media app ive found on top of being free software unfortunately ive experienced a host of issues in recent versions released in november 2019 if you are having issues with smb login with sd card file discovery or with seeking in certain media files you can download the older version 317 as a temporary workaround : 

input: missing next button it seems obvious but apparently not for vlc excellent player but its missing a go to next track in folder button when shooting dozens of videos you just wanna go through quickly missing the next button requires you to either create a playlist or go back to the main interface and play next video according to multiple forums this has been an outstanding feature request for quite a while too bad will pay for mx player : 

input: does not have audio equalizer  : 

input: i love the vlc desktop app but i hate this android app everytime i start the applications it searches for other media even after me disabling the option this process last for 56 min and after all the waiting when i select a video to be played it takes 23minutes to load it i mean why i really hate the android app please developers fix the issue : 

input: the new version sucks its so messy to forward the video or take it back in the previous version it was so smooth but now video always stops when i try to move it : 

input: meh the app is good but something really annoying with it is that you cant edit the name of songs artists etc i have an album downloaded and it wont let me edit it so i cant find what song i am playing because i cant edit the names : 

input: beter than mx player it dosnt provide adseasy 2 use : 

input: its not support hd1080 quality video : 

input: you changed the whole thing why it was fine before now only 1 movie at a time it wont play whole seasons of shows when grouping it wont give you landscaping mode just a straight on the left thumbnail list you just cant leave things alone i use this app every day now im looking for a new video app just leave things alone that arent broke : 

input: tracks spontaneously stop playing : 

input: whenever i am to play a media thats not being played well by other medias i find it easier to browse it with vlc since 2014 upto now i havent find a media that once a vlc failed then it will be an option using the sound thats louder and reducing the speed or increasing the speed and so on but vlc should know that when there is a file that the vlc can not play vlc should be ready to fix that problem before : 

input: i do not know what has happened in the vlc backroom but the latest redesign update has not worked i cannot even begin to go into the errors with december 2019 update because there are too many the worst of it for me is the incorrect song amount information vlc now says there are 760 music files when there is actually 380 3 : 

input: good app app not show ad is beter than mx plyer : 

input: when i download subtitles the video crashes or plays in 2x speed i dont know why this is happening other videos plays well when i put subtitles but then suddenly it happened please fix this its really disapointing : 

input: the save playlist feature is a problem it did save my audio playlist but it showed the wrong number of music within the playlist thus annoyed me to some degree not to mention the playlist itself will not show the duration of the song if the song was renamed i thought i had fixed this before the update now it happen again its a pain to do it again minor problems i know but it irritate me to some degree i hope these problems will be fixed in the next update : 

input: i cant add subtitlespliz help  : 

input: this app used to be my favorite before their new update which eats a lot of memory now even though the new update looks nice but i rather it would have stayed how it was when it didnt take up too much memory i guess it was good while it last but now i have to find another app that doesnt take too much memory : 

input: while im a fan of vlc you made a lot of change in it and lots of videos and movies are out of sync i know i can change the delay of these but it wasnt like that beforethese video are perfectly fine in other video player on pay and etc you seriously need to fix this i dont know what went wrong with your updates but its not tolerable and funny anymore the latest updates screwed everything up : 

input: the default setting is to scan the entire phone upon startup and this setting cannot be changed at startup because vlc is scanning for media i tried to select specific folders and have it only scan after i first updated it but the settings did not take affect its a wonderful player and im glad its available for so many operating systems keep up the good work im sure this will be fixed in future versions im using android 51 on an older low memory cheap zte phone : 

input: there is no off button that i can see sometimes i have to go into apps and force stop to get it to stop playing music whenever i put on my headset to make a call frustrating : 

input: i will use vlc as media player till my death : 

input: why microphone access on android phone you state it needs microphone to provide voice search on android tv devices only asked on android tv devices but why is this permission asked for my android 5 phone can you remove it : 

input: would rate 5 if it had forward and rewind buttons 10sec skip ahead comes in handy to move past the intro montage in all my manga shows i got a new 64bit tab so my mxplayerpro not working on it : 

input: in cast option it hangs a lotit is worst thing in this apki am totally dissapointedin pc version also they removed capture video optionin that also iam totally disappointedi remove desktop versionif they give cast fast option with no lags and capture video option what i seethen i will continue : 

input: this worked quite well with audio files but every video the audio and video were out of sync with audio lagging by a full second or more i decided to uninstall and go with another app instead ive sworn by vlc for windows for many years and if this problem gets corrected i may come back : 

input: crash and crash on tablet 10   : 

input: this last update diluted my love history isnt functional again : 

input: sadly this app is absolutely useless just let me say i like vlc player a lot been using it for ages on my pc but i just started using it on android because the default player on my phone has no equalizer but the music keeps cutting out like i listen to a song for a while but sooner or later it suddenly goes silent while the player is still playing the song its incredibly annoying and makes the player absolutely useless : 

input: the old version is better than the new : 

input: best player ive ever used      : 

input: takes awfully long to index videos takes quite sometime to load thumbnails and playing videos seems to be a hit or a miss overall not as reliable as mx player x player etc : 

input: it is better than mx player it works smoothly but when i try to stream online videos it streams the audio of the video  : 

input: works to a point to play several different types of files ui is difficult not obvious how to do most things id imagine one should be able to do although im sure the developers can make it do much they need some usability testing with folks who are not developing this or failing that some sort of help and tutorial its just not adequately obvious also failed to get it to work through my router not clear what ports etc are needed again probably obvious to folks into the code : 

input: my goto app for computer and androidonly major issues are its refresh rate and power consumptionit is quite slow in refreshing offline media content even after set the specified folder to searchalso many a times it cause the device to heatup during playback which is not noticed in another competitor for same file if these issues are fixed i will once again download this app on my phone : 

input: cant cast to samsung tv        : 

input: this latest update really screwed things up for me too i have hard drive connected to my sony bravia tv with full of movies and with the newest updates when i go to vlc hard drive folder it doesnt load all my subfolders with movies it only loads to the letter h and it doesnt load folders past that letter and i dont know what to do now can anyone help me  : 

input: it should be playing all formats and it doesn t why : 

input: play button hoovering on playlist sometimes works and sometimes doesnt most annoyingly theres no now paying when i pause a song and open another app it doesnt allow me to continue with the song : 

input: having issue with 1920x1080    : 

input: at first when i installed vlc which was in 2018 i could play bluray movies with ease but now i cant play hd videos it keeps freezing and blurring and it all happened after the new updation : 

input: why cant it read videos from otg devices : 

input: disappointed with latest update its no longer possible to sort videos by date or look up info about a video and its not possible anymore either to delete anything from inside the app this is useful how why cant you leave basic things like this alone its not even stated in the update notes so the user doesnt know until its too late this is why ive become very wary of updates they are so often downgrades as unfortunately is this one uninstalled after many years of use : 

input: i dont even like vlc on desktop pcs but the phone app works amazingly well played whatever ive thrown at it smooth seeking volume and brightness controls only complaint i have is i couldnt find an option to disable subtitles by default meaning you have to disable them manually every time you open another file not a big enough problem to warrant subtracting a star : 

input: sorry should have done this sooner i have not used this app but i contacted the developer asking if this app could be used to emulate a flash player or html5 for phones the developer quickly responded and politely explained that it doesnt work that way i know my request sounds weird i was just curious im giving a 5 star because of the stellar service i got even though im not a customer : 

input: best for playing videos        : 

input: dont let this update itself to version 320 onwards you will finish up with large icon art work for each music album you have it makes the ui now unuasble you have to scroll scroll to find the artistalbum you are looking for time to find an alternative to vlc which was easily the best media player out there but now ruined by some moron who has been tinkering with the ui without any consideration for using this on a small screen platform like a mobile phone moronic terrible : 

input: i just need a player which resumes audio playing correctly and can modify playing speed is it too much to ask apparently yes for vlc resume is completely messed up and i ended up taking notes each time where i finished listening my podcast last time apart from that app is infested with bugs just read other peoples reviews here no more pain for me i finally found an app which works uninstalling vlc after so many years being loyal user : 

input: perfect for me but 1 battery drain per hour while idle is unacceptable and might force me to switch to something else what is it even doing in the background every other odd music player is either adridden or full of purchase for premium features vlc is just straight up business not so much to faf about with besides the battery drain its incredible : 

input: the players interface in the notification doesnt have anymore the closing app cross and swiping it out doesnt work how do we get rid of it if all apps would do this the notifications in our phone would be a hassle : 

input: i use this to stream to my chrome cast once the player starts all bets are off its laggy and unresponsive and leaves much to be desired : 

input: before latest update had an easy to read list showing artist album perhaps a dozen in view now i get 3 or 4 thumbnails of album covers heavily shortened text description anybody with loads of playlists is going to take ages scrolling through if i find an alternative ill scrub vlc for good completely underwhelmed update 1 hour after posting above my playlists disappeared songs were jumbled into random albums and some wiped from music altogether its taken on a life of its own : 

input: best app no ads no bloat       : 

input: simply better than mx player no ads easy to get online subtitle of movies plays all weird video format it really did the job done better than mx player : 

input: great app but i cannot give it 5 stars because it crashes when i use bubble dictionary to translate english subtitle to vietnamese after restarted the app there is only sound from the video and the sound keeps playing on my phone samsung galaxy s7 android 7 even when i killed vlc please fix this critical bug and i will change my rating thank you : 

input: playlist organization changes are bizzare i would like to revert back to previous version but cant which means the auto update system forces the user to use each and every new update so specifically when you search for a video to add it to a playlist you have to scroll down each time just to enter the addition the playlist now forces users to o view their playlist in thumbnail in mode this takes up a lot of space forcing the user to see thumbnail images for each playlist name more : 

input: since the november 2019 update it wont scan almost 200 folders worth of music in my sd card despite deleting and reinstalling app during which it froze after downloading it was my goto for listening to my own music hell no neither google nor apple is getting subscription money for tracks i havent released yet going back to the factory app lg i rode with vlc since before html5 but no more : 

input: loop control was not showing anywhere after 2 reinstalls it suddenly appeared where expected app is ok now for the time being wasnt before things like that do happen with various computer devices and doesnt always make sense good grief i was too quick on the draw so changed it apologies to devs to professor pfft make sense how about take your own advice learn to make sense of words or just plain stfu ha as if thanks for the cheap laughs : 

input: i have been using vlc for quite some time have to say that new ui looks better then past orange one it just somehow feel cleaner some things need work one such thing is video list default behavior is to group videos by name on more then one video group tapping it open the group and we can see information from there it group videos in a list of one video if there is no other video with same six first letters now i cant find a way to show information for that one video : 

input: i was a big fan of this player ever since i was using it on my computer long before the android devices and i would have given it the highest rating however i made the mistake of running the app while on wifi and it upgraded itself from v 2513 to v 323 without notice and despite my devices settings to ask before upgrading big mistake because it now is slow to launch and is sluggish an automatic update should not have happened the user should have been warned : 

input: i am a big fan of vlc since a long long time from pc to mobile i was never much comfortable with any player other than this in using mobile to watch shows but unfortunately after the last update subtitles arent downloading and its really frustrating please solve this issue as soon as possible : 

input: no video on my android device  : 

input: when you swipe left or right to go backward or forward in a video then vlc skips for first few swipes and after that doesnt skip no matter how many times you swipe also in swiping backwards vlc pauses for one swipe then unpause for next swipe then pauses for next swipe then unpause for next and so on this pauseresume is happening a lot in swiping backwards and sometimes happening in swiping forward too fix this rest is good till now i saw only these issues : 

input: poor it will play videos and them stop its annoying : 

input: have tried downloading this app many time without numbers but the problem is that it wont display the video but the audio is working underneath maybe you should update it to a newer version that will suite all devices cos i cant keep wasting my data on one app namaste  : 

input: the app is fantastic i havent experienced any problem : 

input: this app sucks it doesnt load the newly added videosand the other flaw is that the subtitle needs to be selected again and again when the app is reopened : 

input: the latest update removed so many important features like aspect ratio playback speed subtitles etc that were available on the player now you have to press the 3 dots and then use these features bring those features back also the aspect ratio is not working properly i was watching a 11 video but aspect ratio was setting only to 169 43 189 etc the best fit set to 169 when the video is 11 so fix the aspect ratio love vlc but these things have to be fixed : 

input: i just loved this app it was perfect and could open almost every media file with it but it all ended with the last update now it takes like an hour to load files and to make it worse now occupies an unjustified ammount of space in my phone memory slowing it down i think that a lot of us would like to fix this error because phone memory is sometimes limited : 

input: latest update screwed everything up for example if i switch to another app from vlc and then go back the font is set to small this problem came with the latest update quitting and restarting the app fixes it the app was fine the way it was now there are plyaback errors the interface sucks assa roll back update will be great : 

input: latest update had caused bugs  : 

input: repeat doesnt work correctly   : 

input: youtube videos wont play through vlc network stream anymore it tries to load and then stops in an instant however it still plays dailymotion video streams can the technical team please resolve this issue in reference to youtube : 

input: l need to extract file and make snapshots : 

input: it works the first time i install it then the next time nothing just a blank screen has to do with the sd storage location only works in internal storage : 

input: this latest update really screwed things up a lot of things didnt work with the last update and its worst than the previous version i was unable to connect through smb to my computers anymore to play video files on my android tv but after some researching i found the way to resolve this is to install smb10cifs file sharing support on my laptop on turn windows features onoff however selecting subtitle file doesnt work as it asks to play the subtitle idx file as audio file and selecting it stop the video playback the group and sorting system on the previous version was much better than this latest update : 

input: one of the best media player and it is free and foss and without ads the only problem i have is about advancedcomplex ass subtitles that dont animate correctly eg in karaoke style fansubs in animes oped other than that its great mpv also freefoss has a better subtitle support but a much simplerworse interface with less features : 

input: dont worry anymore i installed mx player works great previously when are you going to fix this why is the freakin volume bar coming up when you only want to swipe right to forward a video a bit or when you pause once and started playing the video again then if you swipe right to forward it then the video pauses what the hell : 

input: i cant put in a paragraph how much i love the vlc play : 

input: unable to open loaded documents : 

input: latest update broke usability vlc was my favorite app on my cars android gps system it now cant read folders properly grabbing incomplete directory results that randomly change on every load thumbnails no longer fully load extremely sluggish stalls for minutes my biggest pet peeve the solid white icon bg for an app that claims to support dark mode nothing like a blinding white light on the dashboard the vlc icon while driving at night had to switch to mx pro after this update : 

input: generally it works very well but every time there is a software update it forgets all my media and deletes all of my saved playlists which is extremely annoying as i have to create them from scratch every time doesnt seem to let you save the playlists anywhere separate from the live memory so it is flawed : 

input: this works with pretty much any media type and has loads of different options aswell i use it on all the devices i use media on and since my phone is always on me vlc for android and i have gotten to know each other quite well the feature i wasnt expecting but loved was the pop up sized player it really helps to be able to actually use my phonetablet while watching a movie or listening to music vlc on the pc was always installed on my computers when i was younger and now i get why : 

input: the last update was the worst ive ever seen in any app huge ugly icons for playlists userunfriendly interface after the update my playlists turned empty thats right like with 0 media files in them the app is constantly refreshing to identify new media files yet it doesnt actually recognize any of my new mp3s i would pay the devs to do humanity a favor and roll back the update : 

input: not working for hd videos      : 

input: great music app with adequate rendering for lossless files playlist reordering could be more user friendly it needs upscaling for videos 480p dvd quality looks worse on my laptop than on my old tube tv : 

input: i wouldnt prefer any other video player than this i mean the pop up feature increased vol and so many cool stuff its a really good app : 

input: the latest update breaks so much its insane completely unusable on chromebook now just as i was getting used to the previous version this update surprised me with an untested trainwreck very disappointed ive always loved the windows version hope that one doesnt get broken too : 

input: love this app in the terms of video format compatibility and playing quality and functions but it is very disappointing that the file sorting method is limited to by name only if other ways such asby date or by file type thus function has never never been added to any one of the updates : 

input: this would easily be a five star app if not for the issues that have surfaced ever since the recent ui updates on most phones now it drops everytime the screen goes off so unless you want your display screen on in company with this app both burning your battery simply to listen to your audio then you are better off with almost anything else sad being this was my favorite for years would come back if yhey could resolve current problems : 

input: whatever happened with the lastest update has rendered this app unusable upon opening the app it immediately starts scanning me media and freezes permanently ive restarted cleared cache cleared files uninstalled and reinstalled disabled media scanning nothing has worked used to use this daily cant use it at all now will give 5 starts if fixed : 

input: it works perfectly for playing any file but i cant give it 5 stars because of a glaring flaw it literally cannot find anything i can click on files in file explorer and it works perfectly but the second i actually go into the app it says it cant find anything playlists are now unusable : 

input: plays local device videos very well with minimal issues while browsing lan videos via windows smb shares it hangs for a good 3 4 mins before showing folder structure however once able to select a video it plays without issue would give 4 or 5 stars if it didnt have the lan shares issues which is the whole reason i downloaded it : 

input: i have 3013 and it has a well known defectiit doesnt shut downthats something a hostile program does not 1 that ive used and trusted since before apple was popularand no mention of it in the fixed area i suppose its time to move on : 

input: it not ply well mkv video the audio n video not in order : 

input: rubbish why make updates that make siftware worse : 

input: i used this app for many years it was great until i updated it this week and it went nuts it wont download subtitles in my smart tv  : 

input: i used to like this player since i could play ts file videos with vlc but now it wont even play a single damn ts video file after the updates please fix this : 

input: always start play media at somewhere else stupid app : 

input: now this update is worse than what you guys had the previous version is a lot better i cant get grid view for my videos the new look while watching video is lame bad you cant just select play video as audio you cant sort videos by date added and the one for music is giving me in the wrong way : 

input: after the update videos now echosplease fix : 

input: this app has had really irritating problems for years and i cannot even figure a way they havent have fixed if any of the developers are actually using it sometimes videos will loop back to a certain point in the video when theyre finished without the ab loop being turned on in any perceivable way sometimes it wont auto play the next item on a list sometimes it will always play a media from a certain point when starting it yet it doesnt properly save the last play location upon leaving : 

input: i dont like that the title of videos slide across the tile if the video has really long name then you will have to wait a while for the first letters of the title to slide back into view allow us to disable this in settings the double tap duration bug was fixed in the previous version and another that pauses video when you swipe back was introduced : 

input: sends me on average 7 notifications a day yes seven i havent even used the app for months had to uninstall because as it turns out there is no way to shut it off not even a force stop works : 

input: just please improve the subtitles optionsometimes it can not find the subtitlessome kind of errorjust fix this please then i can give 5 starthank you : 

input: well everyone is right this latest update sucks used it after the update and it only loaded 1 of the 20 albums i currently have on my phone and it wouldnt scan my directories to find them plus when browsing through said folders containing my music they were showing as empty so i was about to uninstall until i cleared the apps cache then hit the clear data button now once i restarted vlc it scanned and found all my music and videos havent looked at any other features yet : 

input: great but search option doesnt work well it doesnt include all folders though the option has been selected in settings : 

input: when playing mp4 files great mkv on the other hand bad any mkv format higher than 240p doesnt play perfect audio delay and video freezes could you fix that : 

input: my previous rating was 5 stars but since the app was updated to version 3 and higher a lot of bugs keep coming up the app used to work perfectly but then started to close my videos every time i flipped the screen to portrait or landscape now the issue has been fixed but the viseo file now stutters when flipping orientation also the background play ia buggy if you pause the video wgile in background from the lockscreeb widget and tou want to resume after 5min the app crashes : 

input: its really mindblowing video player i like it very much but this player all time creat a problem such as i cant change a music videoswhen i am watching a video : 

input: before the update i loved this program now im thinking of uninstalling there was nothing wrong with it i liked the folders the way they where and now this list no dont like it some people might like this and some dont why dont you put out a version for those who liked it before and leave it then have this one and update it how ever you like it i know im just complaining and venting but hell just saying how i feel at this moment : 

input: main menu for videos is not so good : 

input: no its not no it cant read the m3u8 file type  : 

input: subtitles are not accurate     : 

input: i installed it good for reading mp4 and stuff but it didnt recognize my sd card i dont know what happened but after installing it i didnt have access to the sd card on the whole device android i had to uninstall it for me to regain access to sd card in other apps : 

input: great but what happened with this last update a lot of people are very unhappy myself included media library folders setting just changed and now only has options for my internal media and external not allowing to remove select directories or to select a specific directory for the media library : 

input: no sort video by date          : 

input: not casting 8 april 2020 the app is cool but the cast icon doesnt show anymore not working with my chromecast or roku and when i mirror screen the audio has been off : 

input: i am sorry to rate 1 starbut you guys made me feel bad when i have to hold on to subtitle delay for minutes to get a 20sec delaycant you just do something like mx player does i am going back to mx playersorry : 

input: there is a button which says got it this is a red line for me it should say dont show this message again ive uninstalled it : 

input: i dont know for sure if it is my oneplus 7t my huawei tab or my galaxy s7 but on my all 3 devices the audio is not syncing with the video i tried different videos same awful experience 2 years ago i was using normally but since then all the same im sorry but i will try another player rip vlc : 

input: vlc is a great media player but the file organization is much better on mx player thats why i still use that as my daily driver the sound quality of vlc is louder than mx player for some videos but whenever i watch a video or movie where i need subtitles i use mx player because it allows me to adjust the position of subtitle vlc should also add that feature its important : 

input: biggest issue is that it scans my directories every time and most of the time it isnt everything example one time a directory it found 200 media files next time 400 plus then next time 300 and this was all in the span of a minute after closing down the program 3 times getting really annoying since it had only happened since this newest update and there seems to be no way to disable this : 

input: this new update just sucks for me when the videos is group you can no longer sort the videos by date or anything else except name which is pretty bad for series lover more over the last playlist icon at the top right corner no longer work i hate this update i had to go search for previous version and download that : 

input: if it aint broke dont fix it the last update not only broke all my playlists but not when viewing an internet stream the fit screen and best fit option do not work properly in landscape mode i am on a samsung galaxy s6 please fix this everything was working just fine until the most recent update in november 2019 : 

input: why i cant play m4v format i used to play m4v format before why  : 

input: what is happening with the subtitle even on my desktop computer the subtitle is not working whenever i tried to download the subtitle and select the subtitle it always routed me on home page the latest update really sucks i better find another video player if this issue keeps on happening : 

input: subtitles arent downloading vlc get bugs when using video as audio only during skipping though its timeline try to do like pc version as i always admit it the best dont let my hope down : 

input: wss a great app since the last update it keeps giving an error that it cant access playlist file and it moves to the next entry please fix this : 

input: its a 5 5 rating but for gods sake remove the volume and brightness bar from the middle of the screen when we change the level it is totally annoying when we change the level of volume and brightness in the middle of the video put these percentage bars in the respective sides of the screen : 

input: i gave it 5 stars originally but now i cannot access any video on any servers on my local networks the servers are listed but when i click on any it never shows folders or files : 

input: have been using vlc for quite a while now and i have nothing but good experience my device is incomplete without vlc media player : 

input: in android box when using android tv ui the video with embedded subtitles didnt automatically used whe should go to subtitles option and choose embedded subtitles to activate the sub : 

input: was great before the last update now the video files are all jumbled when you click on one another different one opens some you can delete some you cannot video files are duplicated was perfect before why could you not just leave it alone  : 

input: latest update kinda sucks i cant double tap to playpause the video anymore i dont see the option for it in settings either i liked the orange background color to the icons on the video player interface better the new ui seems a little bit smoother but i aint really digging it : 

input: local network smb worked beautifully on 317 updated to 323 and the app just gets stuck on loading screen when trying to access local network thank goodness for apkmirror so i can revert back remind me to never update vlc ever old saying is true if it aint broke dont update it : 

input: no ads better than mx player   : 

input: weird glitch downloaded this for five minutes and then uninstalled because its playing 2second voice clips while im in other apps its very creepy to hear old voice messages playing on their own and then stopping this happened maybe 4 times then i decided to uninstall its 3 am too early for creepiness : 

input: best than mx player andno irritating ads : 

input: unable to sinc on internal storage : 

input: itll play anything you throw at it but the management of files and playlists and the ui in general is total trash its strangely buggy as though the developers dont even use their own stuff they probably dont they probably use a commandline interface or something : 

input: by far the best media player always used on laptop and android plays soo many formats just brilliant one downside i had with the last update on my phone was that the list of playlists are now icons and i cant get them back to a normal textlist cant find the setting for that anywhere : 

input: a whole lot more if it would play some music it wont do anything : 

input: 5 star app rating for sure just lacking one important thing it needs the repeat ab function : 

input: please updated advance version like desktop vlc : 

input: ive been using it forever and now im disappointed it doesnt want to open and ive uninstalled for more then 5 times because i like the app so much please fix this problem : 

input: i have used vlc always but today m tying to download the app for an hour its not getting downloaded cancelling the download will try again tomorrow : 

input: unreliable audio does not work while chromecasting half the time and randomly stops playing the file throughout i have reinstalled this app several times hoping it has been updated but problem has been persistent for over 6 months it also seems to leave something saved in your hardware without your permission as somehow the files resume where theyve left off even after uninstalling and reinstalling : 

input: it only shows videos from a s but im sure i have videos that go well past the letter s it has to be a glitch of some sorts because whenever i want to see any video files that start with any letter past a s i would have to temporarily exit it then immediately return to it and the video files would eventually show up : 

input: preferred the older version cant download subtitles without crashing menu play pause subtitles next prev etc opens very slowly on 1 tap pressing anything soon after doesnt register at all you have to wait a bit press it so it can register 1 star just to get attention for fixes : 

input: after trying mx player i prefer the ads : 

input: just downloaded a movie by mistake that had an indian audio track vlc offers a chance to download a subtitle track but not audio tracks improve on that please : 

input: people this app works its great and wow its vlc ill copypaste my moviessongs straight to my phone and it works no worries if youve used vlc on pc youll know what to expect but yes this is legit and after having this for over 2 years on this pos old android now i can confirm i havent had a single problem with it if youre using a default media player do yourself a favour and start using this 1010 : 

input: the newest update is just awful parsing media now freezes midway and a lot of the videos on streaming no longer work not to mention the fact that it takes up way too much room i cant recommend this anymore because of these issues : 

input: this app really suck when it comes to playing videos on youtube : 

input: horrible day after i dl this app i tried using my mobile data thankfully i was paying attention to my usage or i would have been screwed someone found a back door through this app and was draining all of my data only thing i changed was using this app had to factory reset my phone yes i changes settings once dl to make sure it wasnt allowed to access data never again was awful : 

input: it was good till the latest update with my techno c9 i was able to swipe three fingers on the screen after locking the screen which took a screenshot but now even after locking the screen the screen shots appear with disorganisations like volume up down brightness down and up its like it wont lock the screen : 

input: simply not working useless     : 

input: ive had to download this and uninstall twice because there is some bug i open it and it doesnt show the ui it was working but the latest update did something : 

input: this has to be one of the best video players we have today if i could give a score of a 45 i would the only reason i am not giving 1010 is due to the fact that it does not support multitasking very well i would like it to minimize to a small window when i hit the home button to allow me to do something else : 

input: its a nice app but whenever subtitle is added manually the app just plays without one been able to go forwad or backward please do something : 

input: many time this app not work    : 

input: cant cast 24bit files flac to chromecast : 

input: i dont recall this app taking up so much room prior to the last update storing the data for my music takes nearly 3 gb now and sometimes songs do not appear on the list this used to work perfectly and now its more of a pain fix this soon : 

input: there is a bug in recent update : 

input: omg your update really messed my player and all my play listes what the hell are you thinking half the app does not work i like a detailed lists not thumbnails trying to add new music is jacked up the update so bad i uninstaled the new version and installed the older version from my app backup and set google play to never update this app : 

input: it was best player after update its just horrible uninstall : 

input: the cast option is gone        : 

input: i like vlc but the loading stuck in notifications has been an ongoing issue fixed in some builds broke in others : 

input: it was working for a while then it stopped accepting subtitles : 

input: undoubtedly it is the best video player but there is one thing that i think should be solved when i load a subtitle for a video and if i resize the video subtitle also resize with it which seems annoying to me i want to give 5 star  : 

input: really bad for videos while seeking back forward it sucksss audio video mismatch laggs like crazy while other dont i want to use this because it is opensource addfree but i am disappointed team videolabs please improve this update i downloaded vlc from videolan website it works flawlessly v323 there is some problem with play store version  : 

input: its a good app but when i download subtitles it downloads but doesnt show or save ive deleted and installed the app a hundred times just to see if its being fixed but nothing : 

input: i aint able to resume it using recent apps please fix asap : 

input: the pip mode isnt working on me : 

input: the new version is broken on nvidia shield you can play a few videos over smb network then you have to restart the shield otherwise all you get is a black screen it used to work so well : 

input: iv had vlc for years it was a great app until they updated it now its very hard to navigate before it was all on one screen now it seems to be miles long and the screen only has a 2 inch view of if long term usermx player is now better : 

input: i have used this app exclusively on my laptops for years and this did not disappoint on my 2nd smartphone in 5 years topnotch app for a samsung note 10 the versatility with the equalizer settings from base to treble is phenomenal well done vlc community 5 stars no ads whatsoever on this app : 

input: cant play resume video         : 

input: i would give it 5 starts if it didnt autostart on every boot and i have to force close the app contacted the developer and never got a response : 

input: the best video player unfortunately it has intrusive unwanted features : 

input: it was very amazing but this new update disrupted many functions for instance now i cant download subtitles folders but in the old version i had no problem downloading subtitles now i regret updating to the latest version of the app : 

input: plz help my vlc keeps on pausing when the screen turn off am using huawei y5 lite plz help : 

input: problem in cast screen         : 

input: hmm so much annoying things added to current version transparent background when double tap to seek ui not so vlc anymore bigger menu on go to chapters also performances much lighter on previous version so just decided to stuck on previous 317 thank you : 

input: fails on basic features for example a simple notification or focus change stops playback and starts the video from the beginning scrolling inside a video does not work so it is nearly impossible to watch a movie in a whole uninstalled : 

input: used this app for a while and it worked great for no reason it stopped working uninstalled it and installed another video player : 

input: logical setup plugplay every format ive ever used and simple set up make this app the only player to handle all needs that anyone would ever need and thats considering i have abd use the free portion not sure how much better it can be with whatever fee option available : 

input: this version of vlc doesnt open at all ive uninstalled and reinstalled twice it but instead of it to open it just goes blank i even restarted my phone but the results are just the same : 

input: autoplays when connected to bluetooth no way to turn off doesnt even play what i was previously watching : 

input: need video player try only vlc player : 

input: crashes if you close or minimise the app : 

input: vlc is my favourite player but it get me mad when ever i doenload a subtitle all i get is something else fake version of the subtitle you really need to work on that : 

input: it doesnt support external audio as mx player please add external audio support for video otherwise its my first choice : 

input: i used to love this app but the new updates screw everything up i cant delete the video from the app anymore as i always used to do before and i cant sort things by date before this new update i always sort things by date to watch my new downloaded videos why bother to update if its only downgrading your app : 

input: not feeling the latest update i can no longer delete videos which is super annoying plus i dont like how the videos are listed now as opposed to them previously being tiled please leave well enough alone : 

input: my favourite media player but the latest update really sucks it totally messed up everything please bring back the feature that enables one delete a video from the app also the resume playback option doesnt work any more since the update wish i could give zero stars to this update : 

input: the new upgrage version for android tv does not filter the music from storage on artist genre only on the folder classificarion like album which used to be present in the previous version a real inconvience to scroll through all album to find the required album even search doesnt filter very regressive : 

input: vlc has been great since ive been using it but the new releases have a problem with subtitles download it doesnt search automatically anymore and even after manual search it still doesnt download fix it : 

input: needs a few adjustments        : 

input: im not able to download subtitles please fix this asap : 

input: loved it very functional and met all my expectations for a musicvideo playerthat is until the latest update app lags esp during playback cant sort list by last added files everything was great before : 

input: there is no option to export a streaming created playlist as a m3u file so i can share it with others possible on pc version but isnt possible on mobile version sucks and theres also no option to rename the listing so dumb and we also are unable to copy the url of currently playing stream : 

input: the app is way too buggy the videos wont get deleted and should be closed and opened in order to delete it in order to import the files from internal storage the refresh option doesnt work vlc ws not like this before : 

input: this app not show all video of my phone : 

input: im not able to install this application its coming as error and i downloaded the same application from web there also its coming same problem im not able install android 10 oneplus 7 : 

input: forced app if you uninstall it will keep trying to update itself i find that rude and and invasion of my app space i even turned off auto update and it still forces it way through and stops and starts also this app is trash compared to spotify do yourself a favor and boycott this bloatware untill it is nolonger a stock addition to phones : 

input: will not play my file with subtitles at all shows a black screen for three seconds then goes back to the library : 

input: no option for next songuseless : 

input:  hangingfreezing 1080p 60fps videos does not start video from where i left last time always starts video from beginning : 

input: ive been using vlc for ages now you guys ruined it with the new ui updates now i need to click several times to change the screen sizeratio also wheres the option to sort the grouped videos by date modified it can only be sorted by name sorry but 1 star from me until it is fixed : 

input: what the hell is wrong with latest update that while playing any video audio is getting disturbed with a pause kindly get it fix because in previous version there was no such thing or just suggest me the way to degrade the version to the previous one : 

input: its was an amazing app especially with its dlna casting capabilities but with the latest update idk if its due to android 10 or what its not showing the option to cast using dlna now i have to do screen mirroring to play something on my smart tv instead of just dlna casting it using vlc please fix it : 

input: fairly standard video player control system isnt hugely intuitive and could do with improvement but its the parsing feature that really sucks it takes forever just to scan your phone for content and even then it rarely shows up in the app : 

input: all of a sudden when i stream from my nas it wants me to authenticate to every folderfile even if i choose to save the password not good it was outstanding until then : 

input: keeps buffering every time     : 

input: ui is ugly i dont like it but it support all codecs and you will never see an error and even you dont need to download extra codec extentions like mxplayer i mean it is more better than mxplayer and others : 

input: constantly crashes and shuts down i had to uninstall : 

input: it is best video player but i facing some problems with version on note 8if i install 3210 or any version of the application but it showing 199 version always : 

input: i like the app and its pc version it can play videos your device cant play on its own cant play video file it just fixes the problem and can also generate subtitles : 

input: even after leaving the beta the public version is still turning vlc media player scanning for files as soon as bluetooth is turned on : 

input: i have been using it for years its awesome however since some week theres a bug my new media audio are not scanned properly even if i try to rescan the folder it is not able to get the media i have to reinstall the app and then i can get the new media please fix this issue and i will rate it 5 stars ps i have a redmi note 4 phone : 

input: no one cares what i said huhpls fix the subtitles issue ive added the subtitles but it doesnt appear at all why i click the download subtitle also but not working when i select subtitle form sdinternal memory also not visible whyyy this issue happen dont you notice : 

input: it was better before i cant delete any file if i wanted to its always on the landscape mode the autorotation didnt work on it i dont why this is happening but it was far far better before than now : 

input: i love vlc i really do however we got this new bug where the app crashes everytime i try to download a subtitle and it annoys me because this feature is what made me love vlc for android even more when i first installed it anf now its not working  : 

input: it uses battery way too much than earlier : 

input: after the latest update i am not seeing playlist in vlc whereas it is visible in other media player no song is being displayed in the player further to it after latest update the screen simply rotates when the app is opened auto rotate is off and still the issue persists : 

input: it could be the best browser if it can sort serially as after episode 10 it directly comes to episode 1 and then to episode 11 which is very irritating plx fix this problem then i can give 5 stars for sure : 

input: mostly ok until ts files cant be played found solution in the windows pc version where it needs ffmpg something like that to be added in run app android ver still no solution same with mxplayer mi videos can run ts files but cant find here in playstore : 

input: very useful can access pc via samba but whenever i click on pause on the video interface the interface immediately disappears and the video interface is not so fast like in mx player i request you to show the interface for some seconds whether click on play or pause : 

input: it always cuts off the end of tracks abruptly the casting feature has no way to adjust the volume which is far too loud by default otherwise it could be a good app : 

input: whenever i switched a new window and return to vlc it stops and has to refind and restart the video no better ui than pc app eg timer control etc : 

input: should be stock best video player out there simple as that : 

input: dont have shuffle button lame  : 

input: would have given 5 star but the ts video files do not run so smoothly vlc please fix this problem : 

input: a nice fully featured music and video player with a good equalizer and decent playback controls such a shame that it doesnt cope well with large amounts of music i have about 6 000 files in total and the app just simply doesnt detect them after a certain point forcing me to use a more reliable app with less features blackplayer and yes this happens across multiple devices i own : 

input: ive been using vlc for so long so im very used to it but recently i changed my phone and could not upload an applicaton of it because of its big mb so i dont have a choice but to download another app and i was not happy and comfortable using the other applications vlc is still the best : 

input: i have used vlc on several computers for years and am quite happy with that application however on my android version 9 phone the player frequently begins to play a file without even me opeing the file additionally there is no way to shut it off without restarting the phone yet even then after 5 or 10 minutes it will start playing again without me opening the program i finally deleted the program from my phone to search for another until it is corrected : 

input: the widget does not work period first off you can use it to open the app when pressing the vlc logo but playback buttons non functional also it doesnt save your place or even what item you are playing in the widget so you have to go back to the app find what you were playing and manually select it every time it saves place on individual tracks but you need to press play on the album and skip forward to the track you want every time otherwise it will play one track and stop this is very simple stuff that needs to be fixed asap not recommended unfortunate because vlc has been my go to for years on the computer : 

input: overall great but 1 it would be good if it was possible to change the playback speed while watching a video with a gesture changing the brightness and volume is already possible 2 it would be good if the three vertical dots settings while playing a video were more informative why do the rectangle with vertical bar and the round arrow with dots underneath do what they do there is enough space there to provide a short description in text : 

input: cannot access any remote media sources on chromebook comparing it to the ui on ios the lower menu bar video audio playlists network and settings is missing so one cannot connect to a media server and view media : 

input: this app notnever install on my androidit ask to permit drawing over other appbustard app : 

input: works with most videos 810     : 

input: m4a files are detected with a lower length 3 minute songs are shown to be 30 seconds long with a progress bar as long too the complete song plays but going to a particular part in the track is not possible : 

input: really great but as of late i seem to have lost the ability to cast to my chromecast audio : 

input: trying to watch a movie but does not show up where i wanr to watch it : 

input: i use video editor to edit videos but when i try to play edit videos on vlc its glitch and dark with 5 sec and i try other video player and video runs smoothly : 

input: im not sure why all of the sudden playing music is not that good anymore whenever i click a certain song it does not play also when playing videos on my playlist video will stop after it end and doesnt play the next video i think this started after my update hope youll find a fix for this been playing music in google play now : 

input: as far as apps go this is the most fit for purpose media player the ui and features are so intuitive and well thought out that i cant recommend it enough on more than one occasion ive thought i wonder if i can with vlc and not only is the feature where i expect to find it it has extra goodies i have never seen before like fast forwarding through a video by dragging anywhere left to right or adjusting volume by dragging up or down i wish youtube would copy that control scheme : 

input: its not much its not a great app the only advantage i have seen that it can support any formats of videos but the auto scan thing is hateful its taking so much time for scanning its a great lagg to the app the subtitle we download cant take it as a file it will be only encoded with the video we cant see the subtitles files i recommend mxplayer its a great app have a good collection of subtitles etc its far more better than this : 

input: cant adjust playback speed     : 

input: its a good app its way better than to watch videos on gallery or photos its also a 2 in 1 application on whereby you can listen and watch videos on but pixels are a problem 1080p mkv glitch and its hard to watch : 

input: it is still good program but can you please make this autoscroll of titles in menu go away or make it optional at least i hate this feature and it makes finding everything impossible especially on mobile screen please make it stop : 

input: please do add feature to block amr and such form of files from all audio files list playing a call recording or other types of voice recorder file is an irritation while enjoying music : 

input: it works perfectly but the only problem is that the video thumbnails keeps disappearing until i clear vlc data before i can see the video thumbnails : 

input: best player i have in my computer and on my phone plays all kind of format if it cannot play it no other software or applications can : 

input: very unreliable doesnt support playback or resume from where you stopped and also freezes : 

input: ive been using this on android for almost a couple years and have finally given up on it the dealbreaker is the sound is too quiet at max volume in a quiet room i sometimes still cant understand what characters are saying the 200 volume setting does nothing on my tablet volume booster apps stopped working with vlc other apps are loud and clear another very annoying bit is the app gives priority to a files title tag not the file name itself and to change a title tag on an mkv file requires spending a couple minutes per video stripping the tag on the computer its doable but a very irritating hassle ive switched over to mx player and neither of these things are issues mx player is really very great for me so far : 

input: i had an old samsung whos music app would instantly play the last played song when i got back in my van and it connected to bluetooth this app doesnt do that unless its only been a short time that ive been away a lot of my music has also been placed in one folder i have greendays greatest hits in that album as well are red hot chilli peppers gnrs and lenny kravitz to name a few the same is the case when i go in a specific bands greatest hits album all artists greatest hits are there : 

input: when i stop an audio file like a 13 hour audiobook it will not start where it stopped instead it starts back at the beginning meaning i have to remember the exact time i left off and then manually drag the bar to the right time so inconvenient there is also no forwardbackward 10 or 30 control buttons : 

input: could be a great app but there are a few glaring and very important issues first you cannot rename artistsalbumssongs they go by metadata which is incorrect in nearly all situations second it seems to be crash prone with no apparent reasons i can pinpoint or replicate third and most important to me is playback is wrong in the begining of songs either the first 10th to half second of the track gets skipped past or it gets moved forward ie the first 10th to half second plays on top of what should be that amount of time later : 

input: i used to love this app but now it frustrates me whenever i rotate my screen the video that im watching will jump back to the beginning if the video was part of a playlist it will not continue to go through the playlist after rotating the screen i emailed the developers havent heard anything back yet hopefully they release a fix soon : 

input: vlc is the premier audiovideo app for mobile update 311 however was a huge misstep the app functionally no longer works reliably the autoparse feature only seems to find the files its in the mood to find playlists are hopelessly broken etc i have been forced to revert to an older version always a last resort and never a good option please repair this iconic application so we can all get on with our lives nothing else compares to a working version  : 

input: gets stuck in android auto when playing a playlist which contains video as audio songs actually its not even a video just m4a container which is really annoying and potentially dangerous when playing a playlist during driving bc it doesnt respond it also randomly deleted my playlists : 

input: one of the clunkiest slowest most unusable video players on the platform its totally fine for a completely free app but there are way too many better alternatives out there : 

input: ive been using this app for the laast 4 years and never had any problems with until about 2 weeks ago it hasnt been letting me update it in the playstore and everytime i try watching something a message pops up that says its not responding : 

input: i dont know how to rate 48 stars this is classic and simplest video player apps very good app to play video with no annoying ads but as mp3 player need some improvements and fixing eg no folder playing option for mp3 : 

input: why is there no subtitles in the video i want to watch korean live but theres no sign of subtitle : 

input: all my music files disappeared ive uninstalled this app : 

input: the player is constantly rescanning my library i have 90gb of music on an sd card every other time i start the app it spends a ridiculous amount of time first rescanning my library and then reparsing the media even though nothing has changed m3u file support is spotty at best it shows that my m3u files have songs in them but when i try to open one the app just sits there scratching its butt with a 000 song on the screen and eventually crashes the m3u files are all added to the playlists page but if i try to view a playlist it just shows as empty i think maybe the extinf tags arent handled correctly or simply ignored as any selflabeled software developer with credentials from the bottom of a box of cracker jacks would do when optional media tags arent understood aside from that the flac files play just fine but im really looking for something with decent playlist support : 

input: it is surely a good media player but ive found several issues lately that impact the way i use the app firstly i prefer landscape and it sometimes switches to portrait and refuses to go back unless i frantically shake my device note 9 for a while secondly it consistently stops playing after skipping through network streamed video a number of times for example skip forward skip forward video stream has frozen restart app im not talking about network buffering : 

input: pretty cool quite friendly interface and no problems with most formats my issues are 1 everytime i pause and play a video the sound cuts off for a 23 seconds and then theres an annoying clicking sound which is quite loud not happening on any other devices 2 unconvenient playlist set up no option to save the queue as a playlist or add whole folders to the play queue could have more easy acces to multiple sound tracks if available please add some options for soft coded subs size : 

input: this is the only media player that can find and play all of my wma files even the android file system doesnt recognize some of the wma files that i transferred but this player finds them all and can play them all like the windows app the android version is amazing and no ads so far the only small gotcha is that the refresh doesnt seem to always work i deleted a file on my pixel 2 hit refresh in vlc and it still appeared not a big deal as im so thrilled that i can now play all of my music : 

input: it has limited support for playback unlike on windows and mac machines on android this player is lacking i specifically have troubles playing files from ftp with this player its not just slow it just downright doesnt work 99 of the time this player has 0 fighting chance in this department otherwise a decent player 1 star for being free with no ads : 

input: this app officially sucks since the latest updates destroyed all my playlists created wearlier versions of this software displays file directory listing only with thumbnails will not group files wsimilar content in file directory list what the hell happened in this upgraded version : 

input: i dont know what happen to vlc these past few updates the subtitles arent showing ive always did the tutorials on how to activate the subs but it doesnt shown on all of my videos i have downloaded please fix this the substitles in android : 

input: i dont want the video playing tips mode i want video playing tips will be dismissed all time how can i do this tell me : 

input: manual search subtile is headache : 

input: the update sucks using vlc has become a nightmare the backlight doesnt go off after a video and the resume playback option doesnt work anymore ive got to go through lists of videos just to find what i was watching previously and continue : 

input: bugging a lot it cant save where you were at a video when you switch screens or keep the captions configurations also would stop and shut down when you open it again really upsetting : 

input: app does not allow subtitle download : 

input: updated vlc is a mess im deleting something a different video was deleted it sucks it takes a lot of time to download the video and it was deleted in just a second : 

input: while trying to download subtitles it crashesplease fix this issue : 

input: had vlc a long time            : 

input: the pip mode doesnt work       : 

input: this player still lacks ui smoothness and many times thumbnails of videos are not shown as for feature request i want to have option to change subtitle font size like mx player : 

input: instead of showing every folder in the main menu i would like to have them organized by the same parent folder structure as it is in my directories this menu is easily cluttered if you manually organize your files with folders also ive noticed a probable bug if i select a folder in media library then that folder is moved into another folder thats selected there are duplicate files in the main menu after parsing an option to manually parse files would be nice to fix this issue : 

input: i loved this app for listening to audio books as it saved and replayed from where you left off unfortunately it stopped playing my files saying that it cannot open them even though they were still in the same format this may be due to user error or a bug from the newest update will check back in in a while to see if it was sorted you have not seen the last of me : 

input: the new update just made this app unbearable pls go back to the previous versions if youre here you probably dont know mx player go check it out : 

input: it cannot find my media files i configured vlc to scan all directories i dont even have an sd card installed all folders in vlc library folders list say no files not true i have many playable files in those directories : 

input: its a good media player but the latest updates has messed up the experience i just cant get the subtitles to download they appear on the search but they fail to download : 

input: chromecast playback is very flaky : 

input: it worked for years then it buggd out and stopped working it wont read my files problems and problems and more problems fix it please : 

input: it is a fine app but i dont know why the audio volume up to 200 i think was removed from the app : 

input: the new update sucks cant play the video getting stuck for every second : 

input: when i play videos on full screen on my galaxy a50 even the subtitles are cropped is it a video player or some kid making an app by accident : 

input: very good but hd 4k videos freezes in between until we manually have to swipe left or right on screen : 

input: this is my go to media player app but it has some problems it often tries to re find all my music and videos again when i start the appeven when i turn the setting that does that off ive had songs clone themselves both will play but one will have audio glitches and ive had it recently where it seems to crash if certain other apps are open at the same timemainly messenger but besides that its great really cant conplain besides that and its always the first app i download : 

input: why microphone permission vlc for android for tv should be a different app if it needs more permissions still broken : 

input: i use this mainly for listening to audio books works fine as is but i would give it 5 stars if there was an option to go back 30 or so seconds instead of restarting the entire track over sometimes i get distracted and have to pan back and its a pain to have to open the app and input the time on the jump to option nearly impossible to just use the slider when the content is 10 hours : 

input: the only player that is good compared to others 1you can adjust the music quality 2you can adjust the speed 3you can choose from directory 4you can set ringtone 1the music becomes choppy or player has delay to catch up with the song 2some music vids doesnt club together as one folder or album 3sometimes there is an audio delay during video playback hope you his helped  : 

input: app was working well and reads all my music but now suddenly keeps on freezing and when i minimize app to do something else on phone read message etc the music stops playing completely have tried uninstalling and downloading again but problem persists really disappointed because this was only app i could find that reads all my music into the app please can you try to fix it : 

input: i have used vlc for years both mobile and on my pc would be 5 stars but only gets 3 due to a bug where rotating the screen after selecting play all with video files causes the play all selection to cancel so only one file plays before returning to the file select screen ive tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app will gladly change my rating to 5 stars once this issue is fixed : 

input: would have rated it a 5 b4 i listened to an audiobook i downloaded on it there is a lot to be desired as far as listening to audiobooks goes but if all u use it for is videos its great you minimize the screen to do other stuff at the same time as ur watching a video you can even choose the size of the screen if u so choose leave the app and come back to the same place you left off same goes for audiobooks too : 

input: its a really good app but something broke when i updated it now it doesnt show the right thumbnails for the videos instead all the video thumbnails are a jpg that is not in any video : 

input: i use it on mibox android tv the latest version doesnt show all the files in the directory it shows only first 65 files and folders please fix this : 

input: constant crashes on the latest update had absolutely no problems before crashes on app switches on locking my phone screen on switching songs etc if it aint broke dont fix it guys : 

input: cant download the subtitles    : 

input: what happened play a video nuked my supper now no videos will play even the video i played 20 minutes ago will not play : 

input: mx player gives more options than vlc like balance time battery time touch pauseplay next and its consume 87 mb space but mx consume only 54 mb space : 

input: the most recent update is horrible i am unable to load music even though it shows that i transfered it to the music file it just does not show up on the app very bad update : 

input: it used to be 5 stars 1 because after the last update i cant continue listening to where i stopped the app reverts to the main folder 1 because it doesnt minimise anymore its otherwise perfect for my use : 

input: the latest update is a complete train wreck i use it on my tv and for some reason in my networked directories it wont load any video that starts with a letter after g the alphabet doesnt exist beyond g now : 

input: while some features have been upgraded and added great btw some have reduced in quality for instance the slide forward or backwards is terrible unlike before : 

input: pretty bad randomly stops playing : 

input: after the update it kept freezing it wont even show the media on my device i dont know why the hell i updated this appworst misttake : 

input: excellent app dear videolabs i hope if u can approve my request i would like to suggest that u should create add vlcshare share videoaudio like how mx player have mxshare : 

input: it has 2 features cast to cromecast speed increasedecrease by 005 which i really like and i need and was looking for but they do not work properly on my moto x force when i set speed 140 it looks like it plays for a 2seconds than skips sound for half a second then repeats play and skip it might be skipping a video too please fix this the other thing is that if i want to stop casting i press cast button and select disconnect then my phone restarts : 

input: its great the best video app by because other video apps dont allow the volume to go to 200 ive really enjoyed this app but it takes up a lot of space after you have downloaded it and allowed it to access all your media from your internal storage and sd card may you please help us with the amount of space that it takes please ill really appreciate it thanks for a good app : 

input: great until the issues started every once in a while i cannot start or open my playlists this occurs at the same time when much of my music is not found all of it is on an internal sd card which i dont take out and only some of it disappears i really hope this is is resolved because vlc has been my method of choice for wma audio files for years : 

input: i have been using this app for the past 5 years now and i have been loving it the only problem i have always experienced is that video always lagging i thought it was my phone till i got another phone and still got the same thing im using the jbl t600 and for one time i thought that might be the problem so i switched to wired headphones but still got the same results please fix this or let me know if im getting something wrong about it : 

input: hi in this new update if its grouped by name then i cant have grid view please see if this can be fixed in the previous version it wasnt like that : 

input: extremely slooooooooow to index nearly 3000 mp3 files took more than half an hour to index all the 3000 files with other players like aimp took less than a minute fix this and the infamous stars will raise again : 

input: awesome updates libraries way too slow and misses some of my vids but its ok coz once i find them no matter what format it plays : 

input: download subtitles crashes the app : 

input: there is no good folder hiding system in the app add option to hide videos from folders in the root of the internal storage whatsapp and telegram folder without needing to hide the videos present in the root of the internal memory  : 

input: used to be great but now it crashes a ton stops responding in between episodes looses connections with chromecast : 

input: when you have an absolutely massive collection of music like i do it often takes forever for the library to be rebuilt or added to oftentimes music that was there before doesnt show up while other tracks end up getting duplicates searching by artists restricts to album data rather than individual artist credits which is fine for some things like movie soundtracks but detrimental for things like downloads from overclocked remix which credits the album artist to the entire website otherwise the app plays music it does videos too but the gaps start to show once you get a bigger collection : 

input: worked great for years but now almost every song i download doesnt appear in vlc even after downloading it multiple times so i installed a different music player app what what do you know multiple copies of every song i downloaded was in there my downloads never failed only vlc did ill still check regularly to see if the problem hasbeen fixed because i love this app and ive been using it for years but for now im going to have to use something different until you fix your bugs : 

input: its a good media player like really good but the mobile app is garbage vital functions are missing for audio no way create playlist from playlist tab you have to click the three dots on the audio file and select add to playlist this is the only way to create a playlist no way to edit playlists once youve finally figured out this apps goofy way of creating an audio playlist theres no way to edit it your only useful option in the playlist tab is the ability to delete an already existing playlist for video theres absolutely no way to create a playlist at all you can click the three dots on the video file and select play as audio and for some reason that adds it to a playlist but you cant add multiple video files to a playlist using this method so if you want to create different playlists for your videos use power media instead for some reason the morons behind developing the vlc mobile app thought it would be a bright idea to exclude the ability to create video playlists from the mobile app dont bother with this app : 

input: cannot find new songs or videos when opening directly from file manager some songs play as a file with random numerical title if a song resumes where you last left off it will loop on repeat 1 to the spot it resumed from not the beginning will eventually completely die after a couple weeks library freezes infinitely searching for songs have had to reset app and clear data over 10 times to fix issues ive had enough : 

input: randomly songs will disappear from playlists and occasionally will not show up in the app at all the only redeeming qualities to vlc are 1 vlc plays wma files which i ignorantly created and 2 vlc is simpler to use than the other player ive tried the wma factor is the only reason ive reinstalled vlc player as thats easier than reripping all my cds if the playlist bug were fixed i might keep using vlc : 

input: reading all these reviews stopped me from updating the app i would suggest the negative comments to be taken into account the vlc player is great and sometimes its just good to leave it as it is without major updates as it is said less is more spares one time for fixing and people are satisfied with the original five stars for the old version : 

input: delete function is not working whenever im deleting a song it will say file deleted but after 2 or 3 seconds the words failed to delete media will appear and the title of the deleted song will be in the list again even the songs ive already deleted in my files are still in the list of songs of this app also new downloaded songs are not appearing i used the search button cos its supposed to search in all media files but it didnt work too please fix it its a bit annoying : 

input: good allround media player earlier versions used to forget the indexing of my large muic library and had to reload at startup that is no longer the case and all my media is available right away though not organized flawlessly all video formats are supported including mkv which some players do not could use streaming to miracast chromecast isnt the only casting protocol out there vlc team : 

input: does what it says it does but it could definitely be a bit better the main focus behind the app seems to be video media given the massive number of codecs and file types it is able to read from but i feel that as an audio player it is lacking basic functionality that most other music apps have by default amongst other things it doesnt provide overbluetooth playlist information for cars and similar bluetooth devices to use : 

input: cant skip forward whenever i try to double tap and skip forward or backward it just winds back to the part of the video where i want to skip from this started happening in the new update : 

input: loved vlc until last update i only use for music but since last update the app no longer sees my music i uninstalled vlc and installed again now everything is fine except my playlists are gone : 

input: the app is awesome no doubt but theres a problem with downloading the subtitles sometimes it does download and sometimes it doesnt pls check and fix it : 

input: you really missed the mark on the last update no grid view interface is terrible cant delete certain files on the list view why does the play all arrow have to be there all the time : 

input: struggling to download the app had it before but it was just giving me a blank white screen now each time i try to download in playstore it terminates along the way and i have to start over : 

input: its so annoying it keeps scanning the media on sd card and leaving phone memory behind : 

input: it says they fixed crashes but they didnt fix crashes : 

input: it wont play when am using other app : 

input: worked at first on my pixel 3 xl but then it started to run in the background and cut my internet speed and general speed of my phone by 34s causing issues with youtube videos and even simple web browsing this is a huge issue and im not impressed i almost returned my phone because it got so bad i thought there was an issue with my phone would be one star but it did play a couple files that wouldnt play on my native phone platform : 

input: really good player that can play pretty much everything when it wants to for me also crashes within a day of usage and subsequently fails to start at all i can get the player to work again by deleting app data and cache but i dont feel like doing this twice a day worth 5 stars when it works but only 1 star right now : 

input: i like your app a lot it has wonderful features that i didnt see in other apps nothing is perfect your app has some issues such as when i turn off the auto rotation in my mobile the app still rotate the video i got over it by the lock feature but in my opinion it must be a choice some times when i run a video the app just load and not start the video so i close it and start again the video and it plays its not that annoying but its a thing the thing that most annoyed me is that the app loses the point i stopped in the video sometimes so i have to re watch some clips to know where i stopped thank you for your hard work and keep going i will still use the app and i hope that you fix the things that i mentioned earlier  : 

input: its pretty good for offline video and audio player but the stream feature doesnt work i couldnt stream youtube videos would you guys fix this asap please it would be a 5 if it works and would you kindly reply to me wether its only my issue or it is a problem for everyone else and if so do you guys have any plan to fix it any time soon i would wait for the fix if you guys are going to fix it : 

input: i love vlc media player and have always used it windows linus and android over every other media player softwares i can only say keep up the good work right now i have a bit of trouble with the new update with the update there is a new option for playing only the audio in a video file i couldnt get the video to play on repeat the file just ends after playing once please respond and let me know what to do : 

input: i want two more feature in vlc and that is to adjust subtitle size by percentage also not just big small type and let us adjust how to display the name of video in the app i downloaded a video from a website and its name was showing as netfilx but it was not its original name i guess is was reading from the title there should be option to view them like according to folder name : 

input: the repeat option doesnt have the option to loop over all the videos in a directory only the option to loop one video is there or no repeat while selecting a directory and playing it it does start the last played video a much older played video is resumed also add an option to pause playback when screen is touched while video is playing : 

input: well the app works good if it opens up but opening it up seems to be a big issue for me almost 90 of the time im not able to open vlc by clicking on a video file through a file browser it just crashes no error message or anything so yeah i dont have anything more to help you figure out the issue by the way im on android p if that helps : 

input: this is the most versatile and well known media player in existence cross platform no bs my only complaint is that rescanning my media is hit and miss sometimes it works sometimes it takes 2 or 3 long scans and sometimes its so stubborn that i have to delete all app data and settings reconfigure and only then does it find my new files autoscan never works no matter what scanning is always slow : 

input: i am rating this only for its music player after last trying this app a year ago i decided to see if it had been improved by updates i was initially impressed by how the ui looked but like before the lack of customization and some odd design choices mean most people will probably want to look elsewhere for a music player first of all when you select a songartistalbum it does not play in shuffle mode in fact there is not even an option to enable shuffle mode once the music starts playing i have never come across a player with this restrictive behaviour before youre also stuck with vlcs orange for the theme but thats not a big deal hope the community improves this : 

input: audio and video out of sync definitely not the video itself as it is done with all other players vlc does have an audio delay function but it only works in 50ms increments so you can never get the av to sync up the rest of the app is nice but a video player that cant even keep its av in sync isnt very useful downloaded mx player instead much happier : 

input: please add a way to always repeatloop vids until i disable it in the settings like a toggle otherwise greaat software always loved and used vlc for years on the desktop version too and still love it just a slight minor nuisance : 

input: the subtitle is not downloading : 

input: its is to good because no ads  : 

input: lost playlists after update    : 

input: its a great app and can play many video formats but i cant files on my usb drive : 

input: the two problems ive been facing is that if you pause and audio and use some other app nd when you reopen vlc the audio you paused is just stopped and you habe to replay nd find the spot you paused it at basically you pause the audio and vlc just disappears from notification bar the second issue is that if you delete any audio often times it fails to delete you cant delete it it remains there but you cant play it either : 

input: it was awesome since i renamed the songs in my phone storage i tried refreshing and uninstalling the app to vanish the songs which became double after rename in vlc im really upset and disappointed because i havent tried any other music app once i install it for the very first time so fix it i dont want to install any other app i want only vlc thank you : 

input: love vlc for pc so had to have on my tablet it worked great until tonight when for no reason i could discover it started to freeze the video but not the sound when trying to navigate by the progress bar it steps from chapter to chapter fine but trying to move within the chapter the screen freezes but audio continues so i uninstalled then reinstalled hoping that would fix the problem it didnt i also tried a different movie same issue please fix : 

input: this should be 5 stars but unfortunately this app does not group videos in its folders its really hard for me to find the video i want to play since i have many videos in storage and whenever i sorted out the videos say for example by date the next time i use the app it goes back to its mess up order can you do something about this i on the verge of uninstalling this app : 

input: app is terrible after opening and pressing play one has to tap it at least 30 times before it finally plays no help from vlc techs in fixing issue for the past 3 years : 

input: you have nothing to lose trying this app i use vlc on every device in our home cell phones tablets and computers thats 10 devices in total and have zero complaints my boys were 4 and 6 years old and could operate it on their tablets watching movies and changing settings by themselves dont even get me started about the windows version i use ive tried everything i could find for media players and there has been nothing even close to vlc : 

input: used to be the best now cannot even do the most basic things a media player should do stops playback of mp3s after about a minute and randomly stops playing video after a few minutes at least with video you can quickly change orientation and playback resumes for a while until the next freeze never used to have these issues and i dont know why things have gotten so bad but it is a shame and it is making me look elsewhere : 

input: i use this app primarily for listening to ogg vorbis encoded audiobook cds from the library it really frustrates me that the player cant keep queue state between sessions for example if i only listen to 8 of 14 tracks in my queue the next time i pull up the app i have to rebuild the queue and figure out myself where i left off it gets old quickly : 

input: great app but since the last update it seems that app scan is not working anymore i have added a few new videos but it does not appear in my video list as with previous versions also does not group videos anymore i cannot understand why people knocks down one of the best apps you can find and it is also free just report issues these guys always fix the bugs and or issues try to get microsoft and or apple to fix an issue and see how far you get : 

input: although the app is a wellmade app overall it has glaring flaws that make it unusable at random points it will develop a flaw which makes it start the music file or video file in the middle of the song or video the only way to fix this is to completely clear the memory of the application the frequency that this happens is increasing : 

input: current app crashes more than once every single day ever since the update was made it also constantly scans through the memory also premade playlists keep on disappearing everytime the app is updated what gives : 

input: i trusted this app for pcbut i will not recommend this for androidwith other players my music quality is too good but when i play the music with vlc player the sound becomes very distorted whenever there is a bass in betweenvery disappointing : 

input: the last update screwed up with the library location of my videos and the viewing its still good from other players but the latest update killed it if its not rectified asap then ill change player : 

input: once installed it will now always scan your entire device for files and it is impossible to change this setting while it is scanning which can take hours oops : 

input: this is a good app but the continuos play is not working first you could play as long as you can but now once its not in a folder it does not play please do something on it : 

input: used to love the vlc player on my android phones since some idiot decided to delete the ability to adjust eq i will be looking for a new player if i wanted this level of handcuffs id use an apple product a shame : 

input: there is some problem in downloading the subtitles please fix it : 

input: nice app been using it for years but the only improvement i will like to see is the subtitle downloading : 

input: when using the equalizer the effects are sometimes very delayed : 

input: cant find sort by time modified option : 

input: look its been over a year you folks still wont fix the issues videos close them selves out audio the same why wont vlc fix issues i think competitors care more its funny id be willing to pay money for a pro version if these problems went away but its like you guys are just ssholes and dont give uh hit i used to think vlc was cool id always tell my friends about it when i had it on pc over the many years but you folks really just dont care i think ill switch services bye : 

input: my experience was poor what in the world is with the hieroglyphs in the options menu while playing video rather than words are we catering to the illiterate now also each time device is rotated it kicks you out of video preposterous sound equalization is terrible and very tricky to even get subpar or watchable only pro i can speak of is proper codex included from install oh thats it not impressed overall : 

input: this is probably the best video player you can use now ive had lot of issues with other popular video players regarding the ads vlc provides minimal ads for the best user experience and a lot of customizations the only problem i had is the grouping of the videos you can group it alphabetically but we all need it to be grouped by the folder its in which seems to be the only thing thats missing here : 

input: ibe always loved vlc on my pc but as of last night its a complete fail as an app every single one of my music playlists is now empty after vlc parsed four times in a row all the podcast video radio plays and audio books are intact but every playlist that was music is empty and given that when i empty a playlist vlc automatically deletes a playlistwhy are my music playlists empty but are still listed as playlists over 400 songs removed from theyre playlists back to mediamonkey : 

input: i like the apps design but it has issues i have created 9 playlists and spent considerable time doing so then i go in today to find that they are all gone empty deleted when i try to delete songs from my file that are duplicate songs they dont delete the file and song still shows up in the listing yet if i select them it says they cant be found every single time i start vlc up it says parsing media files for almost ten minutes : 

input: no doubt vlc is one of the best in industry but it still has one issue whenever i transfer or download some videos it doesnt search the directory itself and update the list neither after refreshing it does the same i have to uninstall the app and install the app again just to update the list please fix this issue : 

input: its a great app all my various video formats play perfectly mirrors to tv i luv the play options 2 repeat all video files shuffle instead of just from individual folders like other video player apps the only issue i have with this app is that the shuffle seems 2 be faulty when i startup app it seems2 already be on shuffle but its actually not the videos just play in sequential order so i turn shuffle off then on and still sequential then i have 2repeat a couple more times2 fix it : 

input: i gave 3 stars because i use to swear by vlc got so many people using it but now when i click play on a song its not working i have to keep pushing play fast until it comes on most the time it wont and when i choose download a song and try to add to the app sometime it wont this is my favorite music player please fix it and it would be great if you could just create an account that way when you get a new phone u use can just log in and all your content will be there : 

input: smb streaming over wifi has become completely unusable video plays for about a minute before freezing experimented streaming video that was encoded both using constant quality and constant bitrate in handbrake i want to note that i have eliminated all other possible hardware and software issues other devices can stream the same content using a wired connection tried lthe atest versions of vlc in windows 10 macos x and ubunutu 18101904 : 

input: excellent i love that it streams m3u over http only problem is it keeps spontaneously launching and playing even if i force kill it long hold on back button in dev options because of this ive had to uninstall it cant have mucic unexpectedly start playing in the rest room or a meeting ive looked for a way to disable this in options but to no avail : 

input: as an enthusiast of open source and linux this has always been my prefered media player the android version is no exception it has many features that the desktop version has including rss however if youre scared of lots of buttons i wouldnt reccomend it with power comes responsibility : 

input: was really good but then came the updates that completely ruined it for me now it doesnt parse new media automatically like it used to even after manually refreshing i exit the app then go back in and the media files directory is lost the updates come with so many bugs its annoying after so long with this app im forced to look elsewhere now fix the bugs guys : 

input: updates tend to break things the most recent update the one adding the onboarding screen broke the interface to specify which directories to scan for media in because that menu was built for the onboarding screen and has no built in okay option it assumes the next button is available like it is during the onboarding edit okay this is the second time ive had to uninstall and reinstall to get my music library functional in as many weeks not acceptable you need integration tests : 

input: recent update prevents closing vlc after playing media cant close it from the app window cant close it from the notification bar weak watch out if you have a time limit on your porn consumption also adding multiple songs to playlists is a crapshoot you may or may not have to add each song onebyone even if you do vlc will frequently start up with empty playlists or with incomplete playlists missing items pretty lame dude : 

input: i really like this app but theres one problem that i always meet sometimes when i copy a song from my pc to my phone vlc doesnt detect the song that i just copied ive tried to restart both the app and my phone over and over again but it still doesnt detect it but when i change the filename of the song or move it to another folder the app did detect it and when i put it back to normal the app doesnt detect it again if i uncheck the directory then check it again my playlist will be gone : 

input: probably the best allaround player app hats off to developers just one little complaint when a song is playing and i want to pull up the player menu bar since i use gesture navigation oneplus 6t i sometimes close the app by swiping up just a slight annoyance i guess the solution is to make the bar a little taller i can totally live with it tho just wanted to point this out since gesture based control is becoming more widespread : 

input: as much as ive liked the app it is extremely frustrating that everytime i go to turn my screen off to just listen to the music it will stop playing after a couple seconds and wont continue until i turn my screen back on super counterintuitive on an app that plays music even if it was designed primarily for video  : 

input: please add feature to seek 51015 and 51015 seconds and touch seek for mp3 files audio player the existing seek options thought similar arrows is not useful as it we have to press it for long then suddenly it take you to 304050 more seconds back or forward please add such feature immediately same one like in video player it is available i am a student i need to listen to audio lectures so please develop this features : 

input: its good to see that vlc has improved a lot so i will be pointing out the small things that could make the overall experience even better 1 pauseplay at present vlc only allows to play the video from the last position only if it was started within the app itself if the video was started from the gallery of the phone replay starts from the beginning 2 stopping a video by scrolling to the end of the timeline is not instant 3 media categorization should have the same folder structure : 

input: love using this app for my music and vids but lately it has bugs where some of my mp3 songs doesnt appear bec it couldnt read all the files properly also some of my music and vids who doesnt have thumbnails appears to use the thumbnails of other files i find it kinda disturbing it doesnt appear to be like this before kindly please do something about it thank you : 

input: great player playspeed glitch with folders when i play some audio files like podcasts at a higher speed then in the same temp playlist choose a folder i added the app will stall forever and the temp playlist will only return if i press play with a bluetooth device there should also be a touchscreen option to continue playback itd be good to have a to b repeat playback : 

input: for some reason audio quality is really terrible and unpleasant when i play the same videos on mx player the audio quality is much better on mx player i still wont use mx player because they threw ads into their app that interrupt video playback which is pathetic i am on an asus zenfone i use the vlc app on other android phones and it is perfectly fine but for some reason on this phone on the vlc app the audio quality is really bad and unpleasant compared to other apps : 

input: as expected works very good very convenient to tap on the side to fast forward use 2 fingers in the middle to enlarge the image etc there are minor bugs in my android 44 but no big deal : 

input: all i wanted from a media player android tv application is the ability to play all the movie files i plug into it from a usb flash drive simple vlc managed to partially do this before ie play all media files in a flash drive but even that went out the window with the latest update what is the point of forcing the user to click on every single file before it plays i cant see how that makes sense to the stereotypical user so ive moved on to a hasslefree competitor : 

input: it seems very strange bug in this so called best player it automatically decreases the brightness when watching movie then as display tap it make it higher how do this is happening sorry developers uninstaling it  : 

input: kept getting shut down if paused for longer than a few minutes and i had manually scroll to where i left off vlc is great for desktops but i will not recommend it for android phones : 

input: the recent update is a mess the previous one was the best as much as i hate it i now feel like uninstalling the app please fix everything in the app it is a total wreck : 

input: terrible refuses to scan for media shows directories are empty even if they are full of files real shame too the pc version works fine but this android port is useless : 

input: good app but something is wrong with the subtitles no mater how many times i reinstall it it just doesnt work for me it used to work perfectly before the last update : 

input: iphone users listen up only the android version has the highly sought after feature of 200 volume because apple wants to control everything apple iphone users cannot use their phones to the fullest potential with vlc again if you have an iphone you cannot use 200 volume because apple is greedy and charges more for applecare as the standard 1 year warranty does not include replacement due to speaker wear vlcappleget it together and allow iphone users to use 200 volume apple youre getting paid again anyway when people crack their screens and buy new phonesquit being so greedy and controlling and update vlc player for iphone to allow 200 volume this is why as as iphone users to i still have an android backup apple is so greedy  : 

input: amazing app and no ads         : 

input: this used to be the best video player on android but since the last couple of updates the video list will no longer refresh when either new files are added or others deleted the video list remains fixed in time the only way to find an added file is go to to the directories tab and navigate to the folder then play the file from there even then it still will not appear in the video list the only way to get the video list to refresh is to completely reinstall the app fix this : 

input: its pretty good i have 3 issues though sometimes when i open the app it has to parse all audio files on my device and the only fix is to kill the app and restart it another issue is searching for music in the queue when i type a song name it doesnt find it or it just gives me a random list of songs completely unrelated to my search finally abother issue would ve nice to have a favorite feature where you can favorite songs as they play throughout the queue this wouldcreate favorites list : 

input: works great for playing music loaded into the phone streaming though is another matter pause your stream for more than a few seconds and you have to start over that is really annoying when you are 60 minutes into an 90 minute show and have to listen to that 60 minute over again tonget to where you paused : 

input: my goto app on windows but frustrating experience on android 1 not able to save my selected media library folders in setrings once i finish the first setup screens 2 scans for ever and every few hours clears the whole list of scanned folders and starts over again randomly seeing tracks some times sometimes not : 

input: probably the best mobile video player app problems to fix 1 video rate speed goes down to 25 would be nice to have it come down to 3 fps like the desktop version 2 somehow incorporate a frame by frame forward button and a back 1 frame by frame would be awesome if possible 3 the play from ab does not work well it is awkward to set with the menu and you can only set it with the video playing things to add like the pc version : 

input: this is the go to app for playing video on my nvidia shield tv the only issue is smb authentication for accessing secured nass it absolutely will not accept credentials while the vlc for ios used on my iphone and ipad have no issues i have scoured vlc forums and see multiple posts with same issue but no resolution : 

input: my mp4 videos used to work perfectly fine before now a black screen with the traffic cone logo connected to a casting icon shows up while the audio still plays im not trying to cast it to a tv also when i open the videos from my phones original player they still work so the source mp4 files are not corrupted please fix this i loved this app when it worked : 

input: i dont know what happened in the last updates but it somehow really messed up ive been using vlc for ages and it is a reference to me but ive had a lot of issues lately my musics disappear from the list when using or loading the app the refresh button doesnt work it doesnt recognize the album of some files ill stop using this app soon if those issues are not fixed : 

input: awesome video player fixed my chromecast lag edit casting no longer working and audio sync issues : 

input: i use it for listening to classical music albums it mostly works well the music is displayed nicely according to the metadata and the user interface is good format support is good however the pause button has no functionality a few minutes after clicking the pause button the last song is no longer displayed and the place is lost this seems like a very very basic music player function other music players are able to keep track of the last place in all the music through a history function unfortunately other players have huge bugs or inept metadata handling so vlc looks like the best at this moment : 

input: previous to the june 2019 update i had no problems and would have given this app a 5 star rating since the update some of my camera movies that ran flawlessly on the previous version now have audio problems that i cant find any way to correct the audio sounds like uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh etc you get the picture i want to thank the creators of this app and hope that they can correct this problem i have a samsung s7 android phone : 

input: guys if you are looking for a music app that plays in the background try breathe music it works fantastic i plays when the phone is asleep and when im driving i have all my files loaded on my phone i select my file and then click the dots on the right to pull in the album and top the file name it seems i have to tap the name again otherwise it wont play but the original file selected i havent done this a lot so maybe that was just a glitch : 

input: worked just fine six months ago but since these terrible updatesit cant find video it refuses to play video you have to move video out of different directories put them in the root directory of vlc for this program to even recognize that the bideo exists my analysis vlc is one of the best for home computers but for the cell phonetheir just not ready yet in my opiniontoo much work there are too many other programs out there that you dont have to go through all of this  : 

input: love the app and know its capabilities so purely because of its availability on android i had to have it theres a big issue id note which didnt happen until mid 2019 unsure if caused by updates the app will keep opening itself automatically either out of nowhere or after use itll do it and interrupt other apps and continues nonstop neverending uninstalling and reinstalling temporarily fixes the issue until it eventually happens again device moto z3 : 

input: the latest version does not have delete option for single videos if it is single movie there is no delete option if it is webseries of 10 episode then i can delete 9 episode but not the last one : 

input: the widget just disappeared from the main screen and the widgets menu also couldnt you add a button to ff 10 or 30 seconds in an audio as we can do it in a video it would be great for podcast : 

input: works great for my flac files only problem ive had so far is when a new track starts theres a small hiccup or audio skip whenever a new track starts maybe its my phone galaxy s7 thought it mightve been the large flac files but it also happens when playing smaller 320kbps mp3 files i have hardware acceleration turned off any tips : 

input: why has every release for over 2 years been nonfunctional another update inside 1mo another crash on every launch pls supply the path of the corrupted datalast 8mos medialibrary empty errorindefinitewhat th is this : 

input: the redesigned and cumbersome ui has undone all of my playlists had i known that before i would not have updated can i revert back to the last perfectly designed and stable version vlc was great now its broken : 

input: its keep scanning media library directoriesi m not able to see any video or audio file : 

input: i downloaded it for a file format to play which is not playing properly in mx player but it is way worse it cant even play that video : 

input: you said you fixed it but it still crashes : 

input: unable to download subtitles nothing happens when clicking on the download button : 

input: updates made it way worse if i play in the background and then want to watch the video it starts over again didnt use to do that if i try to go a few seconds ahead it goes a few minutes and it doesnt go where i want it go go moved to mx player and it works just like vlc used to work such a letdown : 

input: used to be my go to app for videos but since sometime ago everytime i pause or go to another app when i try to return to my video only a blank screen appears i have to force close the app and restart the video and try to scroll to where i stopped it used to be able to resume my videos when i exit them prematurely very disappointed pls fix this issue : 

input: 1 i used this app for as long as i bare it is a great app but it has some serious problems with hibitrate and hiframerate videos and i mean very very serious problems like 2 to 3 seconds of pausehiccups just to change from portrait to landscape and on my current phone thats just not acceptable 2 i will have to find other player for my basic needs : 

input: i succeeded in streaming movies from my laptop on android phone movie plays good but there are few bugs you need to fix 1 drives from my laptop on local network do not appear sometimes i have to force stop vlc app for it to work 2 sometimes i cannot play movies even though i can browse the folders on local network 3 sometimes name of the movies while playing appear in garbage values for eg movie name is black panther then it shows mdjdidkrjlsssgskkwvdh : 

input: please add a better option for exploring videos i have up to 600 videos and it is always difficult to find a video i end up scrolling back snd forth and not even finding the video i want the sorting option should have ascending and descending option when using date sorting for example the list should go to the newest video the sorting option shouldnt reset after an app restart you guys should improve the folder option where only folders containing videos should be shown : 

input: i had a disagreement with a producer over a mix i was sent due to vlc the pitch was shifting in the song when i heard it at first i thought i was losing my mind but a peer heard it as well long story short it was vlc that was creating the pitch warble when listening to it on literally any other media player it wasnt warbled like that upon researching the problem it was instantly obvious this is an ongoing problem the creators have yet to fix : 

input: cant get it to continue playing when my phone turns off and locks the screen which is why i installed it as i hoped itd continue playing even when that happens any advice on how i can get it to do that would improve my rating yes im aware i can prevent the phone doing that but it overheats and drains the battery super fast which is why id like it to play with the screen off and locked still a good app other than that : 

input: this piece of trash always scans for directories despite me turning the feature off and crashes about 2 minites into the scan if i try and go into the options to disable scanning bia individual directories it says i cant because its scanning so its in a constant loop of scanning and crashing and theres nothing i can do to stop it its horrible software and hasnt been fixed in a long time not giving this another chance ever again : 

input: vlc has improved a lot in the past year as a music player im really happy to see that hence the five stars unfortunately im having an issue with the small area for appending a song to the current play list i repeated hit it and mistakenly play the song instead ruining my playlist docked with maybe a dozen songs even aware of this issue i still cant reliably hit the three dots for the track menu its very frustrating also history view doesnt allow appending to playlist thanks : 

input: its pretty good i like that i can use double tap for seeking rwff its just that i wish i can set how long the jump is eg 5 seconds currently i cant change the seek interval time to my preference because its locked to 10s its one of the most basic features a video player should have in this day and age that even youtube app not exactly a video player have the option to change the seek interval come on vlc : 

input: 100 recommendgreat app with many features but for samsung in the portrait mode the video controls are in the same position of navigation bar so i cant control the app hope you make the option to change the play speed directly from the interface eg by swiping vertically like forwarding but from the top of scree in the audio hope you add directories to artisits albums i know i can choose from outside to open all directories but want to only show directories have audio files : 

input: hi after the latest update with the ui changed and all the fast forward when we press double click isnt smooth and it sometimes doenst work at all so it becomes v irritating hope you guys give a solution for the same asap : 

input: good player but latest update broke way too many things now i need to recreate all my playlists from scratch devs need to test before releasing broken updates : 

input: i dont like the new update i cant even play my videos as audio again the former one was better this new update should have just been only to fix the bugs in android 100 pls i love vlc the tech guys should do something about it : 

input: vlc is by far the best app i have used in a while but i dont know why but each time i try to download a movie subtitle i doesnt work till when i can get to download subs i will still just be giving it two stars : 

input: feature request already implemented in desktop version unable to play playlist file m3u containing start time and endtime vlc just starts from 000 not from start time given and play the full content till its end : 

input: this updated version is not cool at all a lot of things i used to do have stopped working my videos do not playback one of the most annoying things that can ever happen : 

input: anytime i use this app and i want to play the music and after music have played and want to change always the music would play in a single without itself changing unless you use shuffle so that itself can change : 

input: best media player but need to change color amd ui : 

input: annoying notifications in system tray always doing something in background i dont want it to hog the battery : 

input: uninstalling until you fix the loading media controls bar that you cant remove from notifications how did this pass qa : 

input: found it impossible to contact support team so leaving this here i used to be able to stream files from smb server but this suddenly stopped on all devices no issue with server as i can see the files there on same device using file explorer why this has happened and how this can be resolved only left 1 star to attract your attention : 

input: i like this app but heres my problem that need to fix 1 deleting the video files on pc the file still show the video like it is still exist and new video i put in wont show it 2 after moving my videos from internal to sd card the file now showing two same file name i just wish the developers should fix this problem so i dont have to uninstalled and redownload again : 

input: there must be some additional featutesoptions inside the app for perfection remember sorting types name name desc date date desc etc balance audio volumes if this option is checked sorting types inside the directories and folders must also be various not only sorting by name audio playlist menu must have sorting feature too these are some musthave features and options i spontaneously remembered to write as an app review : 

input: as a music player this is by far the best music app out there ive tried cointless apps for organizing my own music collection 60gb and found they are all lacking vlc has a great interface logical organization intuitive fast doesnt bog down my phone and has good sound quality also pretty much the only music app for local playback of music on chromecastaudio finally awesome : 

input: i love vlc i use nothing else for playing video content however casting to my chromecast device on my television has proven to be a pain sometimes it works sometimes it plays but is super choppy and sometimes the video simply wont cast im not sure if this is a chromecast or vlc issue but id love some feedback : 

input: plays movies smoother than all my other media players love the funcionality toolock screen independent brightnessvolume very annoying bug right now if i leaveswitch app it wont reopen just stays black screen even if i try to play another movie i have to clear or force close it and start over so i cant reply to messages while im watching and have to remember where i was in my movie every time i leave app xperia xa2 ultra : 

input: doesnt work with the latest versions of android firefox it no longer comes up as an option for opening videoeven when it is installed have found no solutions to the problem problem presented itself right after a major update to the phones os and after updating appsincluding vlc cant determine where the problem is with os with firefoxmozilla or with vlcor how to fix it : 

input: no real problems with playback importing albums from itunes on my pc to my phone works great however the phone apps own playlist system is entirely unusable i had to google around to figure out how to reorder tracks adding tracks is time consuming have to add them one by one instead of say adding a whole folder at once and duplicate tracks will randomly get added to the playlist which cant be deleted without also deleting all other copies also it is impossible to import a playlist file from pc even after correcting file paths overall works fine if you dont intend on adding any custom playlists : 

input: does what you want it to but dont you dare open literally any other app while its casting cause it will definitely stop the cast and will most likely also refuse to display the cast button ever again as in you will definitely have to reinstall the app to have even a sliver of hope of ever casting again : 

input: seems to have an issue with droppingresuming streams other apps ive used for ip streams dont have an issue maintaining connection and then retrying if it does drop i am sitting on top of my router and testing this and every station drops after a minute or two then eventually will not start again this is not a deviceconnection issue other apps work fine i gave vlc a shot because they are a trusted name the playlist editing features are also weak cant even reorder things id expect much better from vlc for streaming stick with xiaalive and for ondevice or cloud use google music done : 

input: i like the app but i dont like the way you manage it or frankly fixing your bugs the app is full of bugs one of them is that when i play a video from the app i cant change the orientation without crashing the app at the same moment i rotate my device another thing i cant select a subtitle file from the same directory while i am playing the video unless i go back to my home directory and reach the place of the video manually the issue is that it keeps loading and shows no filescontinue : 

input: the dropdown menu used to work i could pause and replay skip or go back a song now its just sitting there doing nothing when i press the buttons if i want to skip a song or just pause it i need to go into vlc and pause it there this used to be my preferred musicvideo player but after the update it just ruined it for me please if possible fix this im using a huawei p9 lite : 

input: i use the subtitle download in this app unfortunately i dont seem to know what i am doing wrong the subtitles always seem to be off either to fast or to slow it never matches the audio ive used the subtitle delay but pressing either plus or minus it doesnt change anything since i dont see instructions nor a help button i guess i can go without it : 

input: excellent media player plays absolutely anything video or audio also plays streams about the only player app that isnt completely dumbed down the only one that lets you browse files and folders on your device one major flaw playlist function is badly broken adds multiple copies of tracks randomly sometimes seems to dump entire folders of media into an existing playlist totally unreliable : 

input: some issues playing mp3 audios since the last two or three updates it all of a sudden stops or pauses playing the audios making you hit the play button again to be able to continue it does not save the segment you have already reproduced or played to be able to continue from where you previously stopped or pausedi hope the vlc team fix this issues : 

input: its a very nice app just that it keeps thumbnails of deleted movies from my memory card i just upgraded to the latest version yet those thumbnails are still there and when i try to play this deleted movies whose thumbnails are showing on the vlc using the vlc player it still cant play so i cant justify any reason why this thumbnails cant just go away my roommate has same issue with his vlc so im not the only one you guys should please sought this out : 

input: there are a number of flaws 1 takes a lot of time to seek to a particular time like in case of 2030 secs i might have as well watched that part 2 if i have put on subtitles and ive come to home screen once then after coming back to the app they disappear and dont display again until you kill the app and restart it 3 the auto rotation behaves weirdly : 

input: horrible somehow the app plays music from where its stop instead of starting afresh ie if say a 4mins music is paused or stopped at 2mins even if its one week laterit doesnt matter how long its starts from that middle whenever u want to play it again and i have checked all the vlc settings and no way to resolve it this is only seen in video app to enable you start from where u stop definitely not music its been a good app for years but totally horrible and annoying to use now : 

input: cant pick up playing audio where it left off if i am playing an album in the car stop to get a coffee and come back it complains that it cannot play the rest of the songs in its queue starting the same album from the beginning works fine this has been a problem since i started trying to use the android version does anyone know of an app that will simply play mp3s from my device on android auto without problems because i have yet to find one : 

input: before version was good after updating it recent version is worst now one cant delete video from vlc player easily no options for deleting video secondly now you cant play video as an audio easily worst version : 

input: for the most works very well save for the fallowing exceptions mobile version a bit thin on tools compared to dt but still good stuff as in all versions can get glitches ok so ask for your money back yep you paid nada so dont bitc did ting is fin fin tacticman disclaimer hard as it may be understand this im actually a very stupid person so ill just say the learning curve whats a bit more than i expected however that was on the desktop so cut me some slack already get it : 

input: the app stops when my phone sleeps after being idle i literally have to be actively using my mobile for the app to play music when the screen turns off so does the music  : 

input: new update was not good there is no delete option to delete videos sometimes it shows deleted files also may be previous version was better than this : 

input: hi very good app and i used to use vlc for a very long time but lately it plays my media in the back ground how do i stop it from playing in the back gound : 

input: smbv1 problem old version used to work great with my moto g5s plus with android 81 but this new version cannot remember passwords you must always enter in router name and password annoying : 

input: not impressive when watching a video it stops at some point and wont play again the previous version was better than this : 

input: dont go anywhere without my vlc : 

input: super app application form 1 mistake in 1 fail open to 2 3 4 5 videos there but 1 video is open then no next prv buttons : 

input: the era of vlc is gone now they dont have much to offer the app sucks mx player is far better than vlc : 

input: best video app hands down      : 

input: its good that finally ab repeat is available in mobile version as well but frankely it is total mess needs total improvement over usability rightnow user cannot even see when actually the points on both sides are set or not the features placement is also in ackward location imagine how one can determine that it is on the menu and then repeatedly go there to setunset points : 

input: everything went well until i updated my android to oreo now player voluntarily switches between tracks in inappropriate moments there was also a kind of problem with google voice that i never use it starts to appear when it feels so i believe that my problem is more related to oreo than to vlc but anyway i wished to write about it : 

input: player is good but when it come to being able to delete a file thats were this app has problems i has music and video file that cant be play not can they be deleted so its taking up space on my phone please address this issue and i will make it 5 star rating please and thank you : 

input: this is the 1st time i installed this app i didnt even played a single file yet but 2 things i already disliked 1st thing is view when i go in videos all videos are viewed together and when i go to directories all folders are viewed even those which does not contain any media file very bad display of ui 2nd thing is time it takes to search for media it took 10x more time as compared to mx player mx player can refresh the whole library within seconds : 

input: recent updates have brought serious problems will rescan parse device library nearly every time the app is launched or tabbed back into even when this function is disabled in options as well proper filenames are not displayed and some files just dont show up in directories at all such as certain mp3 or m4a files that show in other apps also didnt this app used to have a widget : 

input: was a highly recommended 5 now a low2 the video files on my phone tablet no longer show as video files as such all features for video no longer applicable to them or this application since i do not use this for music its almost completely worthless to me now it can hold files play them but it wont keep the place of the file say the length show a distinct icon or tell me if it has been watched before or not the stock samsung app does more for me than this app does now back to it : 

input: versions before 30 are great but why was the equalizer removed in new version i had to find an old installer and turn off auto update because 31 went downhill all my mp3s vanished 2 days after update i recommend version 29 also for ppl trying to add new mp3s if they dont show in list then go to directories tab and uncheck your music folder and recheck it that will reparse mp3s without having to reinstall : 

input: it seems to be not functioning well and as it should be on my s9 i had to uninstalled and reinstalled the app a few times in 1 month and its been 3 months ive been doing so i port in new tv series from my pc but it doesnt show up in the video list some of the tv series i deleted using the pc interface is still showing in the vlc video list i need to uninstalled and reinstalled so the correct video list will be shown i have another video app nplayer on the phone and it works great but drain batt fast so i use vlc instead pls help to fix this vlc you have a great app but if its this troublesome might as well switch to other apps ps i had to uninstalled and reimstalled twice last week : 

input: ive been using this app for years now i havent had a problem with it until it updated automatically so i disabled auto update on all apps my only issue back then was that when i pause it the app closes then i decided to update last night maybe it was fixed aaand now i can no longer play music and its buggy so i decided to uninstall it what a let down : 

input: i loved this player when i had it on my old s2 unfortunately the search bar does not seem to work anymore now that i am using an s8 also when you are in the directories tab and use the android built in back button it just loads forever unless you close and reopen the app this only occurs when you go back to the first screen however so is not too much of an issue  : 

input: anytime i add new audio files to my phone i have to completely remove the app and redownload it in order for the new files to show up i have tried to force stop and then start it again but that doesnt help its a pretty good app for the most part it just has this one frustrating flaw : 

input: for actually playing musicvideo it works fine the trouble starts with playlists they are so janky it makes listening to downloaded songs in order an absolute chore edit 12619 the playlists are better from when i first started but now the app keeps crashing when it does a scan that i did not request and it keeps happening at startup even when i disabled it literally unusable and a complete mockery of the desktop vlc : 

input: ive had vlc installed for a long time it was configured to access a shared drive on my home computer i would open local network then open my home computer and i would see one folder labeled q that was the shared drive on my home computer and vlc would play those files i no longer see the q drive i see 4 folders labeled music videos pictures and playlists when i open those folders and their subfolders everything is empty why cant i access my shared drive anymore is there a bug in a recent update : 

input: i love this app but want an update in playback speed option you see playback speed is only having symboled options and finger can be used but help to indecrease as 05 but fingers also not enough for example i m unable to set the speed up to 108 b like how jump to time is having the keypad to set time think playback speed option is also having number keypads with symboled options due to which anybody can set the exact speed of any song or audio whichever they want : 

input: hey debs this app drives me nuts localfiles bluetooth connections streaming background files dlc consulate drops connections forgets where it was randomly if i change sources wifi networks or if i dont it just seems to have a mind of its own i am on a galaxy note 9 any help at all i posted something on reddit and it just sat there are you guys even working on this app it feels dead : 

input: navigation is made difficult because of the nonintuitive ui something as simple as navigating up a directory is impossible or if it is possible then ive yet to learn how another problematic aspect is playlists i can play all files in a folder no problem but the problems arise when i want to play files from 2 or more folders or even just add more files to my current playlist it has the same playback issues as the pc version if you want to loop a video on most videos expect vlc to skip the first seconds when replaying as well as a delay between the video ending and the video restarting though this seems to be less noticable in play as audio mode and for some reason vlc insists that it will play back where i left off it will even do this sometimes when looping a video ie video ends vlc jumps to the middle instead of the start and strangely the option to turn this feature off is missing very annoying it has many big and small quirks like this that just make the whole experience frustrating : 

input: it seems that every time theres an update something convenient changes for example on my previous device using vlc 2513 i could raise the volume more than 100 but on my new device running v 317 i cant this makes it almost useless for using in the gym which is the main place i need to use it 1 more thing online support is geared for techies not the average user who just wants to watch videos while on the treadmill : 

input: getting buggier with every update new ui sucks what happened vlc used to be a really good media player but lately the quality of vlc has dropped while playing videos if you move the seek bar it freezes the video and wont play at all you have to stop the video and restart it from the beginning or go to a new video and then go back to it and then theres the playback speed years ago it used to work so well with such smoothness now regardless of speed audio is horribly distorted : 

input: absolute musthave app my default player for video and audio the only problem is that when playing high kbps flacs which is most flacs from an sd card at the start of the song it will play normally for around a second then stay silent for about a second and then play like normal for the rest of the song which is pretty annoying and doesnt happen on other similar apps : 

input: this app needs more low ratings due to problems with refreshing the music library everytime you add mp3 files to your device you must uninstall vlc then reinstall it for your media files to show in the library the refresh function doesnt work and hasnt worked in the year that ive been using vlc for android it simply shows a bar at the bottom of the screen that says parsing media and when it is complete you will find that your music has not been added still better than google play tho : 

input: this was an amazing app until the most the most recent update ive never seen an update remove so many loved features before sorting deleting fitting the chopping list is endless : 

input: it was perfectly fine not until with the recent update which has f everything up mixing videos up no delete function and more its really intolerable : 

input: overall works well but the newest version does not give me the option to delete single episodes the delete option only appears if there are multiple episodes of a show : 

input: its infuriating that this is the best app to play music actually on your phone but it seems to be im endlessly annoyed by it playing music from my pocket randomly after my phone disconnects from bluetooth devices and its dogshit playback system has no setting to make songs play from the beginning instead of wherever it left off the last time : 

input: very good but cannot play mkv  : 

input: getting worse every year i have been with vlc for over 5 years and now on xbox wont play half the videos codecs and on android it wont keep playing anything once i hit my home screen go to another app or lock my fone thats not a media player its crsp time to move on : 

input: on pc and on android this program is great i like that it is constantly evolving i love the stability on these two platforms i wish that the evolution speed was a bit faster but i cant complain about a free product that is better than all the paid ones on the market thank you side note this program is fing horrible on ipados : 

input: i set 10 songs to play but its only repeat the same song over and over again : 

input: ruinedits just not functional anymoreloses audio when i rwndfstfwd also takes forever to open files on local networks i regret updating ill have to source the previous version again and make i never update it : 

input: for folder access vlc will continuously reselect the folders that you uncheck for access does not actually provide a choice all folders are accessed not cool : 

input: used to be ok but after last update it keeps crashing : 

input: this is the best video player app for windows 10 pc but unfortunately it is not the same on android devices because some videos are not played properly : 

input: amazingg i not usually rate a video player but this app is saved my lifee usually i use mx pl yer and i love it but then i face a problem that it cant play video from otg drive then i try using this app suprisingly it work so well after the update thx u so much : 

input: no shuffle option was very disappointing making playlists is quite cumbersome : 

input: the app likes to crash or sometimes the video just stops : 

input: i like the app ita problem is playing musics : 

input: frustrating beyond belief refused to play more than a second on my downloaded video : 

input: needs more improvement         : 

input: almost perfect vlc has so far been pretty stable and most features are elegant and enjoyable heres a small list of problems when playback of a playlist begins or there isnt a song currently cached vlc will cut out the first couple seconds of a song parsing takes way too long in my opinion im switching over from eq media player every time i changed a tag or added a new song id have to rescan but eq rescanned my 800 song playlist in seconds vlc takes upwards of 25 minutes : 

input: app is working good however it doesnt automatically sort videos by my preference it kinds of reset whenever i exit the app i prefer my videos sorted by date and when i used the app for the first time i sorted it by date i thought that when i exit the app and use it again later videos are still sorted in my preference but it doesnt it always goes back to alphabetical order and i have to sort it out again i always do this whenever i use the app and its getting annoying : 

input: this used to be my best app for watching videos and playing music but after the update its just trash really freaking annoying i like to play my movies and videos at a little fast speed now i cant with every music or video that plays i have to set it before once i set it its always at that speed it hangs a lot sometimes it doesnt even work please fix this its really annoying sometimes it takes me restarting my phone before i see my new music and videos fix it please : 

input: for a month now i am not able to open any video or audio directly from the app i have to go to file manger click on the item then open with vlc i have to do this for each and every item on my play list i tried to uninstall then reinstalled it again but no the issue is still there kindly work on it its frustrating that i have to search for a video all the way in storage just to watch it : 

input: i like how one of the questions that the rating system ask me directly is this app good for resuming content and the answer is absolutely not on my google pixel 2 i can listen to almost any type of file which is great but when i hit the square navigation button on my phone the app is almost never able to resume the video in fact android sends me a toast message saying that this app is not available more often than not it will restart vlc at its menu screen where it shows a list of hundreds of videos which i have deleted long long long ago then if i hit the play button it will try to automatically select a video based on alphabetical order it seems which will oftentimes be a video that does not exist anymore : 

input: recent update broken in several ways but i think thats the android os at fault for changing their layouts menus popup bars if my phone sleeps while paused or stabbed out playback resumes with no sound requiring a restart and the position is not saved this problem is since the update a week ago please fix ill give it back to your old 5 stars : 

input: i just wanted to be able to play a video of us singing that id downloaded from the choir website my android j3 was saying no relevant app existed tho i had google play and had downloaded another movie app to no avail with vlc installed not only can i find and play the offending vid but i can stream another straight from the website without having to use up storage spaceedit i had to remove app after one day because it made playback very inflexible for things id recorded on samsung rec : 

input: used to be brilliant but major bugs with the recent patches have killed the app it often forgets all of the music on my memory card and it is a pain to get the app to rediscover them each time i have to use a new method to get the app to rediscover the media recently ran a half marathon and it forgot music half way through running which was a real pain as i had to listen to maybe 10 songs on repeat : 

input: make shuffle and continuous loop keep the settings i select stop making me select them each time i open the app if the app is open in the background it should autoplay when it connects via bluetooth because i was obviously just listening to it even if its the only app in still shuts off as a programmer this is absurdly easy to fixchange clearly these are working as intended so give us the option instead allow default settings of the users choice instead of just turning everything off all of the time how am i the only one to mention these things : 

input: this was one of the best players around but since the last update most options dont function your streaming option from a local server no longer works and your smb is now become sketchy at best your suggestion of downloading the apk file and rolling back a version until you solve the issues would be nice but i cant seem to install them ive tried this on different android machines please roll the version back  : 

input: adds entire album to queue for no reason i use vlc as an mp3 jukebox and i seem to constantly accidentally add an entire album to the queue i single click an album to see the individual tracks in the album i add one track to the queue but when i look at the queue the entire album is there and to make things worse the only way to clear my accidental selections is to remove each track from the queue one song at a time there is no option to clear the entire queue : 

input: i used to love this player but since the least updated the pip and play in background functions have stopped working properly most of the time it doesnt switch to pip when you multitask now and even if you get it to do so it restarts your video playing in background stops working after 2 mins then when you switch back to player it restarts the video doesnt even give you option to restart from previous point anymore : 

input: i do not know what the hell is wrong with this appi wanted to add subtitles to my video while casting it on my tv and i kept clicking on the option to add subtitles but all in vain i was very frustrated with this problem so i switched to bubbleupnp which is a lot more better than vlc for casting criteriaeven some movies were playing without audio in this bloody app but bubbleupnp got it right : 

input: nice app but not the best 1 it just doesnt play some videos i had a video for the last 3 months it was working fine when suddenly vlc stops playing it i had to force stop the app and then play it i worked but again after closing it same problem 2 if i close the app or phone standby mode during a video playback it doesnt open back neither when i turn on the phone nor when i switch vlc app again switching worked a few months earlier but now it doesnt after turning on the phone from standby mode it closes the video and on opening the same video it first closes the background video on first tap and then opens the video on second tap its very very annoying fix this asap 3 while adding subtitle to a video it pops up a window with a message no subtitles in this directory even if i have subtitles there the pop up window also shows a loading sign which doesnt close on tapping back button to add subtitle i have to tap on home button and select the subtitle from the directory starting from the top : 

input: i usually download videos on my phone and watch them on the go whenever i feel like it however i am very bothered that the videos that i have already transferred to my pc renamed is still displayed on the videos section of the app as how they were before i wish that this app could have a cleaner interface since it works well for my soft subbed videos : 

input: nice love for playing any kind of video particularly good for straming from nas or a desktop home device but also good for remote devices actually why is the local network section called local if it can stream from remote devices which was pretty obvious actually it took me a minute to figure that out also the gui of the actual video player is not that good if that was a little better i would be happy to give 5 stars : 

input: id give it zero stars if i didnt have access to my songs even though i have to go all the way through the directories then go to my external sd card then click the music link to play anything fix it i put the whole library on the front page of the app at least 3 times probably more ive lost count i had to calm down before writing this because if i didnt it would be filled with fbombs and other curses i loved the vlc player a lot when it works : 

input: installed to play aiff tracks without itunes half the time i open the app it says found no media have to closereload for another spin of the roulette wheel it doesnt automatically play the next track unless play all selected from the individual tracks menu pick another track and you have to repeat the process my ford car controls wont always work with the app i need an app to play music in the car this isnt it going back to the samsung app after converting my aiff files to mp3 : 

input: great player but playlists are a mess and extremely buggy literally no way to reorder a playlist i have a playlist with hundreds of audio clips to be played in a very certain order 2 of them are out of order with literally no way to fix it im not going to recreate it from scratch as a workaround to this annoyance just hope it gets fixed so i can once again ise vlc i wish there was a direct donation you could make to devs to get any idea if work is being done on it : 

input: plays whatever file you have which is great but the jump to time function doesnt work at all even dragging on the progress bar doesnt work as soon as you lift your finger it starts again from the beginning that would be fine on a three minute song not so fine on a 5 hour audiobook : 

input: vlc is the best media player ever i mean it its second to none android pc xbox one if you have some file that nothing else will play not only will this open it it will play it well even if its got crazy 71 sound file and youre playing it on a mobile phone it will still work i would give it 200 but thats not mathematically possible so 100 will have to do : 

input: no rewind button the author seems to be aware of rewind feature because its possible to do by holding previous but only in playlist mode its extremely annoying to not be able to easily go back the few seconds you missed of your daily 15 minutes lesson or a story : 

input: update after several months of use i had to update my review and drop a couple of stars frustrating and inconsistent quirks when it is paused and then you click to resume this app might work correctly and continue playing or this app might stay open but close that particular mp3 file so youve lost your place or this app might totally shut down so youve again lost your place if this happens then when you reopen the file maybe it will start where you had left off and maybe it wont losing your place isnt a big deal if its a music file but if its an audiobook or podcast then youll have to do some seeking these annoying quirks happen from the lock screen and when using completely open doesnt seem to be a pattern randomly works and randomly fails please fix its so close to being nearly perfect this is really a really good media player i started using it on the desktop computer because it was a small file size that played almost any file type you asked it to play i use it almost exclusively for mp3 files the thing i love about the app is that you can increase the playing speed in small or large steps and it adjusts the frequency of course so your audiobook doesnt sound like chipmunks this is a powerful feature i wish you could fastforward the file and not accidentally bump it up to play the next file like every car stereo sharing the ff and the next button so one little slip of your finger and you will lose your place : 

input: i have always used this as my nr one media player but now it is having problems with playing where it left off everytime i press the play last playlist button it plays for a second and then stops i have to press it fast for a few times for it to work but then 2 or 3 minutes later it stops completely and i must open my phone to fix it again ive uninstalled and reinstalled it but the problems persist please do something about it : 

input: not a bad app but when youre listening to music videos and you click the option to have it play in audio mode and then you can turn your phone screen off and everything when the next song starts it jumps halfway through the song or itll just go straight to the end so it wont play the next song from the beginning it does this to all the songs in the playlist ive checked the settings and nothing fixes the problem : 

input: so far the app has been working pretty well for me my only complaint is that when using chromecast you have to leave the app unlocked or your video will stop playing and you will have to find where you were again when you leave it unlocked your screen will go black to save battery life and it will turn back on when you touch it but even when unlocked it will stop playing sometimes : 

input: there are so many problems 1 please allow us rearrange our playlists 2 why cant i mark multiple and delete please fix it 3 why i cant find a whole lot of videos on my device in vlc these among others are the major issues right now ill get back to you soon hopefully this is as nice as someone can get do understand it is constructive criticism  : 

input: seriously why remove something which was useful why only the sort by tab only has name earlier it had duration last modified many options also we were able to delete video in vlc why remove all those functions : 

input: this is a really good universal media player i like that it allows me to sort music files by artist genre etc as well as add them to a playlist the ui is very easy to navigate and it does what i need it to do my one issue is that only about half my music files are showing up in the audio screen when i navigate to the directory i can find and play the files that arent otherwise visible but they are all stored in the same folder on an sd card so im not sure why some of them dont appear in the audio screen it doesnt appear to be a format issue either as nearly all the music files on my card are mp3s if anyone has a solution please let me know because otherwise this is the best musicmedia player i can get on an android device : 

input: this app was tunning fine within the last 2 days the app claims have no media files the app will stop playing and a pop up message says the media file doesnt exist then all of my playlists are empty : 

input: there is an update feature where the list of titles in a file scrolls through on each line like a 24hour news screen so say i have a file of 10 movies all 10 lines move across the screen over and over so i cant just read the titles at a glance like i used to its extremely unpleasant to try to sort through especially for someone who already has visual processing issues other than that the app is good but that new feature is awful and not sure i want to continue using the app : 

input: this update has screwed up the organisation of videos i liked it in tiles but now it is a list and button colors were more milder than they are now and the skip 10 seconds was silent and cool than it is now plssss bring back features of old version hate the new version : 

input: does not cast subtitles        : 

input: experience were good been having vlc for years love this app but till to day i download it again after i uninstalled it more then twice tbe problem it just show a black screen cant open it please please advice : 

input: latest app update is reduced song sound quality with decreasedapp size and features equilizer is worst for the latest update 32 so i reverted back to my 31 : 

input: it cant read mkv that well for a video im watching : 

input: postupdate my huawei smartwatch can no longer see vlc in its status menu edit i uninstalled and installed an older version overall preupdate its not great for music it has basic nedia featurew like playlists but the implementation is messy and unforgiving ie making a 25 song playlist when you accidently tap a song instead of holding on it to add it and vlc wipes your playlist and makes a new playlist of that one song there is no way to look at the recent playlists or undo : 

input: i used to love vlc for the most part still do however since upgrading it ive lost the ability to sort by filename instead all i have is by song title as a result my albums are playing in the wrong order now and it is very irritating can you add back the ability to sort by filename please : 

input: why you guys make this app complicated after every update the app was working fine untill the last update and now the playlist option is shifted to another place turning onoff subtitles are too complicated the title of the video is missing in video menu as well as in the video the last version was good but the update made it too bad to use fix it : 

input: the latest version has the worst delete function ive seen firstly you have to select delete twice before the app registers your input secondly then you have to confirm that you want to delete the item you want to delete and thirdly if you have a video minimised in app then you cant delete anything because the minimised bar is overlayed over the option to confirm that you want to delete another video or item so you have to wait for the video to end kindly return it to the old version : 

input: thank you for the update please more bug fixes i often listen to videos with screen off and vlc constantly forgets the time i paused a video : 

input: vlc for android will not play webradio streams with my chromecast audio renderer it appears to connect it even displays the artist and song title no music sometimes theres a message saying the stream cannot be played but when i disconnect the chromecast audio device the stream plays on my phone i understand that google has discontinued chromecast audio but spotify and every other app ive downloaded work with it with no problem not up to the standard of vlc for windows by a long shot : 

input: on my phone with verson 3013 works great on my media box with 314 the last two lines on drop down menus or directory listings are invisible the last two entries are there but not visible on screen the screen doesnt scoll down far enough to show them but i can tab down to them and select the two off screen choices also with playing dvd iso files from network 314 has jitters visible pause as if buffer ran out : 

input: nothing to complain about everything looks good works fine just like the desktop version however if you could grant me two wish i would hoping that you could give me an extra small size subtitle as an option because as of right now the small is still kind of big in my 2014 720p display also sort by date feature thanks : 

input: its great except i had to uninstall since it absolutely insists on opening and automatically playing the last file opened if i pause or stop it just starts again close the app reopens and starts again force close relaunches again what a nightmare ive had malware that was less intrusive : 

input: vlc for android was and is my favourite media player however v 3013 casting from android phone to builtin chromecast of sony androidtv android 70 doesnt work just black tv screen with video title unable to start video sony recently updated the tvs builtin chromecast to version 136145507 still not working again the same black screen the vlc for android app is not listed yet in google play google castapps anybody an idea how to solve this or am i missing something : 

input: there is something wrong whenver i stop playing movie and want to start another one selecting from external file browser total commander the vlc still try to play the previous one same when connected bt headset vlc started playing old files from history unable to stop it had to uninstall besides that streaming to home wifi device android tv box dont work at all it show only vlc logo on tv and no video played would you be so kind and take a look into it other stream app work like charm eeg webvideocaster ive stopped using vlc : 

input: the only thing that i dont like is that you cannot organize the video files in the apps video list i have movies personal family videos and also tutorials but they are all scrambled together there is an option to group the files by the first letters but i dont want to title every movie i have with movie  : 

input: this version of vlc has made the app useless the only good thing is that u came up with night mode there were a number of equalizers in the previous version which had a personalised experience of listening to music now i lost all those equalizers and the app is by default set on a loud equalizer which is only suitable for low volume songs please fix this issue bcoz this app is of no use for now : 

input: ive been loving the new update for the music player very simple to understand and navigate the menu system the video player has all the settings you will need and runs like an absolute beast my only quarrel is that while it can run high quality video with no issues i do sometimes experience frame skips with super highres webm videos every now and then if they are unprofessionally made : 

input: i dont even need to go into why this media player is amazing fixed my codec issues for playing certain file types and no ads thats so fhhcking rare now a days for android apps theyre garbage and full of ads vlc holds up to their high standard and does not disappoint youll find similar apps im sure that probably work well too however theyre going to be riddled with intrusive malicious ads and be a general pain in your rear thanks vlc i give credit where credit is due  : 

input: serious high quality audio reproduction and great video it appears all known codecs play this player has some rough edges on audio though the music tries to start before the buffer is filled and will gap on initial startup this needs to be fixed hd bluetooth performance is exemplary and very high quality with excellent dynamic range and resolution my biggest complaint i cant seem to find any method of replacing missing album art from online sources that took one star off : 

input: hi vlc inapp subtitle download has not been working for quite a while whenever i try the option the response i get is some error occurred please try in few seconds i have tried in seconds minutes hours couple of days its still the exact response could have tried an alternative but your no ads experience is exceptional : 

input: disgustingly invasive app it decided to access all my phone call recordings from another app and there was no option to prevent this or remove them from vlc then i ended up deleting them in the vlc app not knowing that permanently deleted them from my entire phone so i lost years worth of important phone recordings thanks vlc why dont you just respect peoples privacy permissions should be way more limited i have uninstalled this horrible app : 

input: indexing files is horrible i cannot see most of the videos i downloaded and even after being refreshed for a couple of times it is still the same : 

input: ive used vlc for ages and it has never disappointed i bought a new phone recently after my other one died since my new phone has much more storage i decided to put my music collection on my phone being a traditionalist i wanted whatever media player i ultimately went with to play only whatever folder i chose and in the order i put them in as if i were listening to that folder on lp well its like vlc read my mind as they all show up in their proper order vlc rocks : 

input: after the update subtitles not working anymore i cant watch movies with different language other than english : 

input: please add an option to disable resuming or make it the default with short videos its annoying having a 3 minute music video resume or to be asked if you want to resume every time the next video plays : 

input: with latest update songs name keep on moving from right to left even if that song is not playing it gets very irritating when one is searching for song by scrollingpls fix it : 

input: subtitles dont work when changing app while casting the player crashes when accessing the controls while casting the screen shuts down continuously impeding the use annoying experience : 

input: what in the world have you done to the interface this was five stars ive been using vlc for years and also on my pc what genius came up with this horrible new layout : 

input: the problem with the player is that next song doesnt play on its own one has to select the music file and play : 

input: when the screen locks the app astops it needs to restart it there after unlocking the screen : 

input: i use it to watch local videos then stream them on a chromecast it works but if you leave the app then come back without closing it it gets very glitchy and pretty much breaks you have to shut the app down then reopen it for it to be able to stream on chromecast again if you are just watching videos on the phone it works perfect if you leave the app and come back it usually even remembers where you are in the video and starts a few seconds before you paused this depends on ram and how many apps you have open : 

input: i so much love the app but i am tired of it actually wasnt like this before it doesnt detect new files even if one refreshes and thats a big turn off i cant keep uninstalling and installing because i want new files to appear its very very annoying : 

input: so where is the option to stop autoplay after finish playing 1 video for android tv version after the update it keep play the next movie i prefer the old style view of the settings when playing video where the option is on the middle not on the right side also after i stop watching the video i want the screen select that video file back and not selecting back the first video list its annoying to scroll back the playlist : 

input: best player out there for handling multiple different file extensions many standard players do not recognize many common file types but i have yet to encounter an audio or video file type that vlc does not accept the interface is a bit bareboned but it does what it does very well and its free so no ads : 

input: used to work properly with my 3000 file music library on android pie after using android q beta for a couple days i reinstalled pie now vlc doesnt see any of my media files even though file manager lists them all the beta debug version does not fix my issue so vlc is useless to me now too bad i really prefer vlc over all the other players ive used edit using the directories view shows the media in the directory the audio view shows no media found in the music folder : 

input: previously had a bug that rendered it unusable but on my current phone pixel 3 xl its mostly working ok however when i open a video from outside vlc eg from within files app i cant switch back to vlc with recent apps once i switch to a different app or hit the home button instead i get app is unavailable or a black screen if i close and reopen the video i have to manually seek to the position i was at with all these bugs ill switch to a different app tyvm : 

input: i would give this more stars but over the last year or so this app will occasionally delete all of my playlists some of them are hours long i love vlc for pc but not so sure anymore about android this is really the only problem for me but so frustrating i wish there was a way to fix this : 

input: ive been a longtime vlc user and it is still the only video player id like installed on my pc now ive downloaded it on my android phone and fell in love with it instantly the dark theme looks awesome on my screen and im really happy it is there always the darker the better i was confused between mx and this app and the fact that the former has 500m downloads was really making me go for mx except for the 6 tag for the adfree version uhh yes im kinda broke hehe blush i havent tried mx to be honest so i dont know how it compares to vlc but im happy with my choice regardless thanks to the develolers and contributors behind videolan and vlc hopefully one day ill be able to donate meanwhile i encourage other users to drop a review and support the guys for their work peace : 

input: generally love this player but i download long videos and dont watch them all the way through in one shot i cannot get this version to pick up the video where it left of and resume playing always goes back to the start thats a deal breaker for me : 

input: its decent except for one annoying problem when i move or delete my movies they still appear as thumbnails in vlc their location being under storageemulated when i delete them they just reappear and refreshing the media library doesnt change it please fix this edit you fixed the problem i had thank you i will change my rating for this app : 

input: despite the fact that vlc is one of the most advanced media players in the field your android dev team has had a real test of wits compared to other media players of a perceived lower calliber like music player and km player i would go for those less placed players anytime over vlc vlc cannot play anything in the background or even beyond locked screen for more than a minute meaning that you can only use it without doing anything else with the phone review for huawei mate 9 on android 9 : 

input: it was a good app since last update after the update i am facing a lot of problems in listing to music the app is getting closed in between a song i am not even able to listen to one complete song after 2 mins its stopping i reinstalled it thinking the issue will resolve but no use i you can provide a solution ill again install it : 

input: the program will often forget that there are music files video or mpg on the sd card or if you delete music files using the phone vlc will still retain the song title but not the actual song therefore populating the music list with deleted song titles i cannot delete files using vlc installing vlc media player you get to auto or manually seek music within your phone manual scan said i had 43 files select folder now reports i have none otherwise works well : 

input: thought id found the perfect music app until i tried playing a song and thats all it did played the song the only way to listen to a series of songs is to make a play list or start from track 1 and listen to everything else in order i want to listen to album 3 of 7 but it wont let you : 

input: untill the latest update i loved this app however the newest update has some annoying problems like the newly downloaded shows saying they have been watched or makeing me click ok on 2 parts of the screen to delete something if i press delete that means i want it gone especially since i have to scroll down to the delete option also videos have had the wrong thumbnail but other than that l love it hence 4 stars also how do i go back to a old version the new one is annoying : 

input: this app was great but the new update is awful my videos are in separate folders in my phone and vlc used to group them all on one page for playliststyle viewing but now they dont i can put vids all together on an actual playlist but they cant be manually reordered within it secondly theyve removed the sort by date feature which i need to play my videos sequentially vlc has removed the only 2 things that made this app useful to me cant recommend uninstall : 

input: used to love vlc 5 but its a headache cant find out how to lock controls on to the screen such as pause why does pause have to be 2 touches away explaining this to passengers while driving is dangerous but it needs to be paused stopped or volume down instantly doesnt stay playing when kids accidentally hit the home key makes driving so stressful just for trying to listen to a play list oh and cant appear to shuffle after selecting a single item to play very inefficient pls fix : 

input: theres no way to give the vlc devs enough praise there is no onedoesall app for media but none come anywhere nearly as close as this one especially the pc app its not a quickanddirty media player so dont expect it to perform like greased lightning on cheap 5 yearold hardware this is where 90 of your critical reviews come from for most apps just download it theres no way you wont find a good use for it no nags no ads no downside 10star project : 

input: it doesnt support chromecast which is a very important function on android phones and it shouldnt have been overlooked also the controls are not quite optimal l have been using vlc on pcs for many years and l commend it for being part of the open source environment same on android as well but chromecast function is a must : 

input: great but with some playback problems the playback feature skips ahead about 30 minutes when listening to audio books it also does not take title info from the name of the files and causes issues with the order of files the issue can be fixed by making a playlist but i think there is somesort of disconnect between playlists and audio section which may be the root of the playback issue : 

input: absolutely shocking the app accessed some of the videos on my phone i didnt want it to so i deleted them individually on the app only to find it had them deleted them off my phone as well videos of my newborn are now lost forever because of this there is no where in the settings of the app that states this happens or an option to turn this function off : 

input: this is sad vlc used to be excellent but it can no longer handle even 720p mkv files without crashing or losing audio when seeking it was so bad i wasted an hour rechecking the files etc surely they were corrupt or something not a few months ago i was watching 1080p mkv files without issues i have no idea what they did ive tried messing with different settings to no avail the cringiest part is the builtin crappy media player that comes with android handles the task just fine oof : 

input: following the most recent update vlc refresh seems to populate screens by artist instead of by album artist even when this option is not selected in settings also when an artist is selected then albums always seem to be sorted by year by default instead of by name which is a more sensible default if one changes the sort order to be by name then this selection is not remembered this is very frustrating to use when one is trying to simply play a chosen album by a chosen artist : 

input: this is d best video player after mx player i love d pip feature its nice d ui is nice but theres no theme feature however i notice some glitches with d appsometimes it takes a bit of time to play video in pip mode its unstable plus it doesnt play subtitle file in some videos my suggestion videos to be sorted by time added d media button should be set to play last played video not first video a button to quickly switch to pip mode is better than d screen orientation button thanks : 

input: the vlc player is a charm to use and could be used for the videos that arent even supported on mx player it is really satisfying to use this to watch videos and listen audios i would rate it 4 out of 5 the only one star i didnt give is for the reason that there is no on screen volume control for the audio songs which i found very disappointing please developers introduce an on screen volume control option for audios just like there is one for videos thanks : 

input: gets the job done way better than builtin players like the variable speed moved to a different player recently because it never remembers my place when listening to a long file no skip aheadback within a file and hard to precisely position playback in a long file like an audio book also havent found a way to re order playlists or export them so i can edit them with something else would be good if it had the ability to edit metadata rename and move file path all in one place : 

input: audio mp3s are constantly cutting out like the audio plays too fast for the app using mediamonkey until this is fixed : 

input: it is a great video player for laptops and computers but some features are missing in the android version 1 cant rename media files like mxplayer 2 cant sort media by date 3 doesnt display file size overall mxplayer has more features but free version contain ads for better experience pro is better option for window an linux vlc is my preferred player : 

input: plays stuff meant for itunes so i dont have to exclusively deal with stuck up apple its probably one of the best things you can say about any player : 

input: hi could u guys fix the subtitle issue when i pause to do something else and return back to the app the subtitles are gone actually the subtitle feature is all around very buggy but otherwise great app : 

input: why did you break it where is the eq control or the preamp i sure cant find em theyre not where they used to be vlc is the standard we compare any other media apps to why did you break it : 

input: this app was phenominaly good now with the latest update its just annoying cant play m4b files to vlc from my storage most files dont show and i have to go to directories yo find them its just a pain : 

input: used to start video from where you left off after update not anymore 1 step forward 2 steps back been using vlc for years might have to change if not fixed edit uninstalled : 

input: this app just keep on lagging when it comes to 1080p videoscompletetely unsatisfactory : 

input: very very very waste app why because it is not connecting to tv i am trying not connecting tv very wastehow to connect tell means super : 

input: it worked better before the latest update why am i having problems it used to remain at the time slot i pused it at when hopping between apps now i go back to continue watching and app closes i then have to reload the video and search to find where i was last in the video so annoying please fix this thanks : 

input: i switched from rocket player premium because the app constantly started breaking with recent updates this player has the same issue but its worse with jrts player it would destroy the database after a couple hours of playing then take five hours to rebuild with vlc it rebuilds after the entire app is closed sometimes switching back to vlc after playing a 15 second youtube video destroys the database and i have to force close the app in settings for it to actually rebuild again : 

input: the update before the this last update i think messed with the app for about maybe a week or so i didnt see anything wrong but two days ago it made all the video picture previews become the same picture there are still a few with the correct preview picture but the majority of them are the same picture already tried deleting the data and resyncing my videos but it didnt fix anything plz fix cuz youre the only player 8 like on android : 

input: doesnt work well with subtitles there have been multiple occasions where the subtitles wouldnt show even with all the correct settings and i had to close and reopen the app 10 times before theyd finally appear switched to mx player : 

input: why why the new update its so limiting now instead of rewinding to the begining of the song and exiting out easily i have to go back in the app and find out how im supposed to turn off the music and the layout for the music tracks and stuff is awful i cant find the equalizer anymore and playing audio while phone is turned off is a pain in the ass now plz fix this since its unbearable to deal with the update was admittingly a huge letdown : 

input: defaults for video rotation and hiding fast foward button are stupid as well as the lack of option to sort music by date modified to see latest additions but other than that this works with tons of options no stability issues like g play music frustratingly sort preferences reset everytime and the app closes shortly after you pause music when others dont i really wish vlc didnt have such a bad ui cause itd be great otherwise : 

input: i used to love this app for listening to saved podcasts etc however since the update the resume button has been removed this used to let me play directly from where i left off but now i have to go through the history to find the episode and guess a time to continue from will be looking for alternatives : 

input: love the pc version and this is a good player for free but the interface is really not intuitive i will probably stop using it because i cant fast forward items im playing disappear from the interface and other frustrations im really surprised how difficult it is to use : 

input: undeniably excellent application which ive used for many years but it now seems to be getting a bit heavy or not tested too well on older devices despite maxing the acceleration on mine its stuttering enough that ive had to install alternatives which play the same audio files without issue : 

input: my mediaplayer for the longest time now recently switched to a htc 10 android 800 i encountered a few bugs with the audio interface all of my music is on my sd card plus thumbnail images in almost every album vlc doesnt show all artists in the music interface although i can navigate into the respective folders via the dictionary function the thumbnail detection doesnt work for all of the albums after clearing the database and running a new datascan vlc doesnt detect the same albums : 

input: last update just broke the app 90 of my music doesnt show up and of the 10 that does show up only 5 plays while the rest just doesnt respond when i try to play it tried another player and it worked so the files arent corrupt and its not my phone time to uninstall until they fix this train wreck of an update : 

input: do not use this app when i pause music and even video i go to resume a few minutes later and the app will close i then have to reopen and start playing the song or video and it doesnt keep its place so im can never pause music or movies without restarting the app and my place in the music or movie in which i was playing uninstalling this annoying app : 

input: while im not sure how extensive the features are on the vlc but i do know it is the best video player ive ever used and its free onscreen controls for brightness volume and ffrw no fumbling deviceprogram searches which trip up or stop the video play just to stoppause raiselower volume or screen brightness too bad bezos cant spare a few dollars off his trillion dollar company to write a program for his prime video player vlc puts amazon to shame : 

input: love that it has no commercials but hate that it didnt show a song i put on my memory card on my phone i also hate that it doesnt play all the songs on the memory card in alphabetical order but will when u hit the shuffle icon if yall can fix that ill up the rating to 5 stars : 

input: no longer allows me to cast to my tv it used to do it i dont know what changed i know its the app and not the device because other apps continue to cast this is the only one that has stopped casting to my google device attached to the tv : 

input: the new update is not good as a long time user 5 years this has got to be the worst update the fact that its longer to refresh if theres a new video or sometimes cant refresh in general its a letdown i wont be using this app until the new update comes out or at least just downgrade it the old one is way better : 

input: its pretty unreliable playlists randomly vanish as did the playlists link i spent hours adding specific tracks to a myriad of playlists and for a whole 5 hr drive i had them then on the return not even a playlist option is there ironically almost all of the mkv videos are soundvideo phase distorted and seem to be very jerky all in all along with the pretty awful recent vlc for windows update i believe videolan is on a downward spiral sad really previously it was the must have tool : 

input: i changed the file names of my shows i want to watch and vlc player uses some other title unrecognisable to me and proceeds to play all my shows in a completely random order it also doesnt save where im up to correctly and i have to spend time finding where i left off the equaliser volume booster is good though : 

input: auto scan is not working properly it is showing videos it scanned for the first time i moved a video from its location and the new directory of the video wasnt updated when i added new videos to the devices inorder to view them i have to visit the appropriate directory from the directories tab in menu section its taking so much time for scanning videos in my device i hope you might fix these in the next update : 

input: andoid ver used to be really good but now it has annoying glitches i can no longer choose between ext int sd all folders playlists it displays as unknown though it scanned all storage for music the only way to find songs is alphabetically the controls disappear when playing a song i can no longer choose folderplaylist repeat song repeat all in folderplaylist pause stop play and to stop i must reboot phone please fix android 8 oreo galaxy s8 a : 

input: the pc version sets a pretty high standard for being minimal and unintrusive but this app starts every video with swipe gesture instructions that hover over the video until you tap dismiss this i appreciate having instructions but why i need to be instructed every single time i play a new file is itself beyond comprehension and lazy app development : 

input: i use a file browsing app to connect to my server and nas it connects fine after i allowed the nas to use smb version 2 and up vlc however shows only the public folders but fails accepting the smb credentials whatever format i use vlc shows smb authentication required this happened in previous versions at least a year ago too why hasnt this been fixed already : 

input: hey its vlc if i had a toaster it could be installed on i would its playlist organization is pretty miserable but thats not its strength as with the pc version if its a media file even an obscure format vlc will likely play it its one of those goto apps that really belongs on any device that can play media files : 

input: ive using this since 2008 on my laptop i really love this app but since i update this app cellphone few days ago im kinda little bit of disappointed when you scroll down or up the list slow motion interface trash and settings too far away from old one tsk : 

input: i have been using this app for over nine months but had to uninstall it as it failed to update my video and audio list after several attempts at refreshing playlist and updating app though it can add new audio and video files automatically when parsing media it always fails to remove files that have been deleted from phone storage : 

input: works like a charm i absolutely love the internet streaming function that comes along with the app the sd card media scanning stuff is kinda iffy though because it thinks some of my other nonvideo file format iso files to be videos i guess i cant complain too much because everything is more or less working very well so far : 

input: minimal and relative user friendly gui stable app however several major flaws in the gui often cannot continue where i left off especially when headphones are disconnected or playing stops by external reasons if this happens i need to choose the entire playlist and manually skip the needed tracks not a single track for long song names you cant see their entire names in the normal playlist you cant see looking at the playlist at first sight which song is actually being played : 

input: loyal to this app for quite some time but ever since the last update the screen dims and brightens for no reason at all without the percentage of brightness changing it only happens on this app tho so i think its not my phone and when the brightening and dimming happens my top window isnt affected just the app hope i get help thanks to the developers edit it seems like the app gets confused at times whther to follow the brightness i set in the app or follow the system brightness : 

input: hi vlc developers i love your app on my pc and my phones but lately since the last update vlc got worse for the mobile version it can not arrange media files by date or type some of the onscreen functions do not work properly unless you rotate the screen and the much worse is that vlc suddenly stops workingplaying especially when playing long sound media more than one hour also the program notification menu on the lock screen is poor without the played media library thanks : 

input: this app always seems to stop working always has done for years just rubbish really and annoying works well to start with then boom nothing not using it again ever : 

input: i tried to download subtitles but it isnt working it wasnt like this before i update it please fix this : 

input: good but has a few issues first its doesnt adapt well to network changes itll stop midstream and never recover if you go from wifi to lte so you constantly need to reload the streaming url if vlc was smart enough to recover as soon as a connection was available itd be great second it doesnt handle stream metadata well itll display artist and song title the say unknown artist and unknown song once these issues are addressed this will be a solid streaming app : 

input: please if you have an old version of vlc dont update it this new update is unbelievable gosh you cant resume a video after leaving it for few seconds lets say while seeing a movie you got an sms slide to your inbox to check and then come back to vlc it hangs and until youu close it and start the movie afresh it remains so this is annoying : 

input: doesnt support 2160p4k videos i mean the video stops for a while and the sound goes on after 1015 seconds the video brings the ongoing scene : 

input: the media files list is inappropriate : 

input: vlc is my primary choice as video player smooth setting easy controls gester control is awsome but vlc has very bad file scanner it doesnt add files or folder automatically i have to add manually few i dont know whats the problem but i move all video files to movie folder but yet newly added file dont show in vlc scanning has some issue thank you : 

input: the fit screen and center option for videos are not working as expected its too big when i select fit screen and too small when i select center best fit please fix : 

input: since the update all my 43 videos are stretched horizontally in landscape on my tablet even when i select resize 43 thanks a bundle back to mx player then that does it right : 

input: same problem with jeremy plays for 10 secs then stops then plays 10 secs again : 

input: am having problems updating it hangs at 44 and quits there need help : 

input: audio and video desyncs if you try to rewind the video every half second or so : 

input: a lot of games that i played before and like to play wouldnt load and play was very : 

input: ive noticed in the past a subtle amount of wow when say listening to music through the vlc app im not sure if the problem exists but i think i can still hear a small and probably unnoticeable amount of pitch and speed instability : 

input: full of bugs after the the time sleeper turns the app off it wont play anything more without closing the app from the app settings also it runs continously on the background even after closed whether with sleep timer or by any other means cant swipe it off from the notification scroll down bar and keeps consuming battery : 

input: playing ts files other the network does not show full time of the file just 0000 at the end also fast forward fast rewind or jump to specific time not working with ts files 09042019 new update after 1 year and ts files other the network still does not show full time of the file after changing audio stream video and audio gets out of sync also with new update vlc does not ask to resume video but plays from the start uninstalled switched to kodi : 

input: this app hasnt been updated in about a year definitely needs updated codex and bug fixes related to audio playback the only other complaint i would have is a feature enhancement that would provide the ability to zoom or pinch a video like you would an image : 

input: always loved vlc on all devices pc and mac used it on all my android phones however on my huawei mate when i close my phone the muskc plays in the background for about 15 seconds then pauses automatically never had this issue i made sure all pernissions were set correctly and to allow it to run in background ect is this a bug or is it my phone model : 

input: 2 previous upgrades ago vlc player would automatically detect new music files added now it doesnt even try to do that it just needs to clear up a couple more bugs then it would be great 23 feb 2019 updateit still has the same problem : 

input: often vlc shows just random numbers instead of the file title for ex 11235 etc can this be changed so i always see the actual file name also when playing audio straight by clicking an mp3 file for ex the vlc interface doesnt appear at all the thing just starts playing and i have to click the vlc icon for the interface to appear with controls etc is there a way to have it small for ex on the top of the screen when you play an audio file like many other apps appear thank you : 

input: people are complaining about music playing capabilities download power amp as its an actual music player i use vlc for video playback power amp for music or mx player for video music as its been well developed for both as for vlc player very good for free but u get what you pay for i pay for my apps so have the right to complain when they dont work but if you download free apps be greatful they put ads in free apps to pay for there program because how else can they make money : 

input: great app turned into a headache after android 90 rollout or after the latest app update dont know why but now it just abruptly shuts down cant listen to a whole song because of this its nothing to do with the lock screen or anything its just terminating itself : 

input: great music player with a few hiccups when loading a large music library my reason for using vlc is google play musics somewhat retarded way of reading and partially ignoring tags vlc doesnt have this issue and doesnt tell me to pay for a subscription that im never gonna use because i still buy cds and digitize them the ony problem with vlc is the apps weakened stability when loading 28 gigs of music edit 3 it hasnt crashed a single time since the last update : 

input: doesnt work with bittorrent when im launching downloaded tv episode mkv 1080p from bittorrent its playing normally but then if i switch between the open apps or if i just minimize then maximize vlc app its sometimes impossible to restore vlc window i mean vlc app just appears on the screen for a second and disappears moreover if i try in such situation to reopen the video file from bittorrent it doesnt help again that flickering of vlc app : 

input: this app was impressive at the start after the updates its now very disappointing keeps crashing fails to load movies seems to be filled with bugs now it has stop working : 

input: you cant pause when you get a phone call whioe casting if you do the video wont pause in the case that it does pause after you take the call it will then cut out the volume then if you try to close the app it wont stop castingat all i had to unplug my chromecast in order to make it stop playing the volumeless video that was still being played on my tv gyst : 

input: i used to really like this app for some reason now my videos are unplayable due to it skipping and lagging all the time the horrible pc app does this as well going to stick to mx player at least i can change subtitleaudio tracks on that too unlike this : 

input: vlc has always been my choice on pc and is a fine video player the android app however has been consistently crashing on this lgg6 whenever i put it in the background even for a moment and while there is no other app running making it frustrating when returning to it has i have to reopen it and find where i left off to answer a text etc : 

input: entirely improved wrecent update used to need to uninstallreinstall every other day or it kept saying i had no media even while it was playing something that problem is gone cant reorder playlists at all but this is the only android player that works for all my music take what you can get its free not full of ads id gladly pay a small annual fee or something for a better design ability to edit playlists but that doesnt seem to exist : 

input: its a great app no doubt but i have an issue or lemme say i have some stuffs thats always happening in which i dont like 1 once i minimize my vlc in which i was using to watch a movie to attend to another app and i end up going back to it vlc just stops and makes me start my movie all over again 2 why does the app just stop just like that all of a sudden after ive opened it if its gets minimized btw i use an infinix note 4 pro : 

input: i have been using vlc for awhile and liked it but since the last update i have issues with it i cant start playing the songs consecutively from any where on my list any more when i press play all from any song it jumps back to the beginning for this reason alone i will not be using it anymore : 

input: several downgrades to old version sound outage when pausing and resuming video audio always resets back to 100 when over 100 power button pressing two times while video is running shows unresponsive ui instead of pausing and resuming video audio volume setting is delayed delete needs confirmation again instead of undo : 

input: this was always my first choice for playing videos but recently ive been facing issues with it the subtitles are not shown properly now they are stretched out and disoriented frequently also the subtitle delay function needs to be a little more easy to use this is a major pullback for me and im now looking for a good replacement : 

input: when i pause a video in vlc switch tabs and then go back to vlc almost all the time the app freezes the audio is never in sync with a video file i have to adjust the audio sync even though no other video app does this if the issues i wrote down were fixed this app would be perfect i enjoy using vlc on windows its a shame the android version isnt good im on galaxy s10 plus : 

input: newly added music files arent shown when i select the refresh option they sometimes show up when i set sort by to recently added but this needs to be done at least twice to have any effect also it would be nice to have a feature to edit the song data like title artist etc : 

input: not like the pc version at all cant get it to shuffle repeat play audio in the background nor will it play if the screen goes off for any reason this is a definite uninstall for me my note 3 running pie has the factory book style cover if i close that same as turning the display off vlc stops playing not good at all for listening to music : 

input: just works well many options like playing video as audio picture in picture mode streaming to chromecast instantly download subtitles set audio delay sleep timer you name it supports many different file types very reliable easy seeking audio and brightness controls couldnt be better : 

input: its amazingly difficult to figure out the interface i enabled audio only for videos now i cant figure out how to get video back shuffling videos means i have to play all from the first video then visually deselect shuffle from the menu of which theres like five menu dropdowns available you can double the volume of videos but seemingly not when in audio mode half your actions seem to result in starting over from the first episode : 

input: ive been using vlc since 2011 on my pc then i have continued using it in 2015 on android os i was quite satisfied since may 2019 today i havent been able to play songs to finish the app pauses the tracks then ill have to resume all of this happened after i have updated it on my nokia 5 guys please look into it : 

input: great videomusic player but with issues for some reason streaming to a tv the subtitles quit after about 2 lines super duper annoying also for some reason it has issues working properly with google chrome if those are resolved then its still the best there is but those issues take it down a few notches : 

input: edit midi support was removed previous i love the player for it supports everything as opposed to the desktop version this one even supports midi playback one part i noticed that can improve is though there is a support for pip mode i would like an option to automatically switch to background play when i turn off or lock the screen currently i need to make this selection manually : 

input: overall the best player but since the update it doesnt pack the videos into folders and they moved the resize button one click away which gives a bit of a uncomfort : 

input: no subtitles when casting to chromecast they show up on my phone but not on the tv when i cast how can i fix that problem : 

input: works well yet needs to be uninstalled then reinstalled for unknown reasons audio performace deminishes freeze ups also occur no doubt by way of corruption coming into the app by way of google : 

input: vlc is my favourite player in case of pc but its sucks while on phone ui is not good videos are grouped from all sources in the ui and that is the main and only reason i hated it its should be foldered as such in the source folder check mx player for instance but one thing i must say it can play any video may be its ui sucks but its a very powerful player and video supports unbeatable only lack is the ui and folder option : 

input: while there are a lot of good things going for vlc as a media player i cant stand the fact that my audio samples keep getting chopped off at the end during playback i cut audio for a podcast and this is not only an unacceptable feature they havent fixed this issue in over 10 years thankfully i have other media players to use as an alternative : 

input: recent update has been a disaster video photograph disappears next to the file details leaving a empty gray outline have uninstalled the application and will not reinstall until issue has been resolved : 

input: my favorite player only downfall is the lack of aac 7 channel support i have to switch to mx player pro when i have a film with aac 7 channel audio mx player plays this audio perfect : 

input: i dont understand why ill download this app 24mb and in a few days i check to notice that its occupying 600mb why : 

input: good player but several bugs search function often doesnt work or created playlists suddenly disappear but the good outweighs the bad : 

input: it cant play next video        : 

input: this is a bad video player because when the screen of the phone is turned off the video is played from the beginning : 

input: used to be my favorite but been crashing like crazy lately disappointed : 

input: i hate the latest version since when i open my videos it usually black then i press that thing under the playlist and after i sometimes skips then it crashes : 

input: hate it its crashing           : 

input: hey you vlc player is good but when i want to play youtube videos to vlc player or i copied link and paste it to stream option in vlc it cant open or play video so i am very disappointed from your product fix this issue : 

input: was a good app for music video etc however with the latest update certain features no longer work specifically for me the sleep timer doesnt work and not all my audio media is recognised both of these features used to work fine : 

input: works great as its desktop counterpart the gesture controls are great but it take a whole lot of screen space that to bang in the middle of the screen when using gesture controls i wish it would just show minimal info at their respective sides in the form of sliders rather than taking a big chunk of screen space which is quite annoying while watching videos using it as secondary app just for the same reason : 

input: dont like how i cant set the arrangement once and it stays have to pick my prefered way to sort my videos every single time and videos already deleted still appear sometimes as 2 files its extremely annoying something has to be done about that because vlc is an amazing app little things like these should be a long lasting problem coz its fixable : 

input: leagues more efficient than google play music this application is the sams program i choose to use across all my devices and for good reason it isnt intrusive like the google play music and doesnt have the glitches either kudos vlc ive been a huge fan for a while now and the only thing youve failed at is disappointing : 

input: vlc is the only nonstock videoaudio app that i have any experience with using computerized phones which i only got my 1st smartphone 25 yrs ago im 55 yrs old was satisfied with flipphones and my imac desktops until sept 16 my imac was hacked by russians and for 9 wks they went undetected from both me imac os security using terminal to change permissions system op coding etc etc to hide their daily use but the vlc player is far better than 4 different stock video apps used : 

input: ive had this app on almost every cell phone and laptop that ive owned and its been always a great app even though lately it has been acting up not showing my new music and video additions on the library and not playing videos at their regular speed : 

input: i always use vlc to watch movies but it could be a lot better if the screen will auto rotate even if its locked also there are times when i pause a video and use different app like facebook or any other app the video will start from the beginning instead of resuming where i left of : 

input: really love this app in the new version theres a problem i wanna share when some song is playing the app gets slow for some reason i dont know scrolling up and down is slow switching tabs from audio to video is slow all was smooth in previous version hope that the devs may solve this bug : 

input: i can hear my music this is good but suddenly months ago and there is no bettering there it begun to empty my playlists the playlist is there but empty ans only one at a time works if i make a playlist the other one that i had before is now empty i also have to always control if the songs are still in the playlist as its half empty all of a sudden also it has deleted songs from my albums like there is only the score left in moana i have the cd but i cant just always restock : 

input: i would have rated this 5 stars previously but moving the audio playlists from where they were to another directory has made it less pleasant to use and added in more steps to get to your playlists 2 stars for a stupid and unnecessary change if it goes back to how it was ill update this yet again they have messed with the interface with no good reason to do so and made it arguably worse yet again in addition to making it forget all my playlists im removing another star for that : 

input: after most recent update vlc no longer plays video all i get is a vlc traffic cone that looks like its touching a screen mirror icon and playback of the sound from the video i found the fix for this issue vlc needed permission to play on top of other apps once i enabled that vlc works great again another edit this did not fix the problem : 

input: tested various players on a few years old tablet large video files this is the only video player that allows extremely fast seeking times on a 28gb video it takes under 3 seconds to jump to another section of a video unbelievable the only thing i need is file sizes when i browse the list of videos looks like there is no option to show that : 

input: i used to absolutely love the beta version this one i am having a terrible experience this app rarely ever resumes playback from the last spot i left off and i dont like the jump to time feature i wish it was still the scroll selector like in the beta version makes it much easier nagivating in with one hand : 

input: i was looking for a video player that played in a pop up window and was pleased to see that vlc has this it plays all my videos no problem and also has audio only playback which is nice the only thing i would like to see added is a seek bar in the popup window so that i can skip forwards or backwards : 

input: nice equalizer looking for an app without a random function feature sometimes vlc shows a play button sometimes it doesnt somerimes it plays more than one song in a row sometimes it doesnt tried it a second time wont read my sd card even with permission : 

input: good but ive noticed as my gallery grew over time some of my videos and pictures would disappear from albums and the gallery all together in files i can still see them but i cant access them redownload or change storage basically telling me theyre lost forever when the app says theyre still there : 

input: the player is an example of featurerich software with none of features implemented well screen orientation changes are random and hectic ignoring actual screen orientation playlists just suck no possibility to create and extend a playlist other than by starting a video and pressing a button in tge contextual menu bottom up approach no possibility to manually rearrange the items in the playlist plus other counterintuitive ux things in summary overpromising underdelieverung : 

input: actually expect better than this from vlc mainly issues with playlists make this a less than ideal choice for one large list all entries were duplicated i could just remove one but it removes both thinking they are the same plays them all twice tho other glitches too like not remembering random play order etc make it frustrating to use oh yes apparently a database is used for the playlists too so no easy way to manage or backup or transfer and no answers from support : 

input: the only problem with this app is that it never goes next while playing from track list until you shuffle if you play particular song from track list it keep on playing the same song until you play another and that also goes the same way i would request the developer to fix the problem by the way the app is great : 

input: everything is ok but there is an issue while casting media on a smart tv when i play a media file through casting option and then i open another app the cast only lasts for a minute on the tv and then closes forcefully i checked the running apps on settings and found out that the app closes one minute after running in the background i also tried to find the option for keeping the app alive but failed i am on android 9 and i think the app should have a built in option to run uninterruptedly : 

input: buggy as hell one day everything works fine then the next it cant play almost half of the playlist for no apparent reason just like that out of the blue you can still see all the songs are still there but it will just skip half of the titles and display an error message why still play the rest is a mistery it looks as vlc has got a soul by itself and act autonomously deciding what to play and what not samsung note 9  : 

input: works great although i have 1 issue whenever you download subtitles by the inbuilt feature then switch to some other app or take a call or simply lock the screen and get back to the app again the subtitle is not available to load if you try to download again it will show as already downloaded have since then found that the subtitles get downloaded into a downloads vlc folder but its really annoying to pause the video and navigate to the folder everytime : 

input: there is a bug which leads to app freeze when timer is set and it reaches its end from that time is is not possible to restart play from any source app needs to be force closed and then it is possible to select source to play again it was observed in m3u streaming as well as playing local mp3 using android 9 and samsung s9 vlc support is unresponsive too : 

input: unlike its desktop counterpart this app is counterintuitive and glitchy for example why do i have to play a track and then open the playlist it is under in order to rearrange its order the issue of doubling the songs on said list has also frustrated me to no end as i spend more time deleting the double entries than actually listening to the music after which the entire playlist is deleted along with the tracks forcing me to repopulate it im extremely fed up and definitely moving on : 

input: not happy with this app i need an app for my android tablet that will not only playdisplay from the sd card from my dashcam trailcams but i need to be able to save and share those images as well this app plays the videos very well but there is no way to save or share the images several complaints about this on the vsl website guess i have to find a different app because using my phone to film the video while its playing on my tablet is a pain in the a : 

input: what the heck did you do to this app i cant find anything anymore its a jumbled mess when it comes to organizing the videos can only sort by name doesnt put them in a folder like it use to used the app all the time but going to ha e to find a new video player until its fixed : 

input: great app except 50 of the time the app hangs after playing a video getting stuck with a black screen i cant exit from it either resets my phone or i have to remove and reinsert the battery to make it work again reinstalls and updates dont work have been patient for at least a year : 

input: like the desktop version but on your phone i really like the sort by folder option really help me keep stuff orginized can read any videoaudio format : 

input: yoooo ulllllllll the new update is litty the new ui is clean and easier to usesee plus they fixed an issue regarding my phone s10 honestly wouldnt expect anything less from the folks at vlc 5 stars  : 

input: recent update messed up the apps capability to download subtitles the rest of its features are intact i just dont like the new display : 

input: i love the app first of all but the latest update has screwed everything up i used to be able to access files through vlc but after the update all my folders are marked empty fix this please : 

input: when i play songs on the background it stops simultaneously this is really frustrating : 

input: needs playlist creation and management unless i havent seen it : 

input: amazing player but it would be perfect to add an option to give playlists a custom thumbnail and an option to bookmark tracks in a playlist : 

input: has an equalizer great app but is now minimizing itself when turning screen back on use to be easy to rewind a video to rehear something but now always minimized when turning screen back on looking for playersettings reset but dont think i changed anything might have to go with another player was never doing it before update : 

input: only video player other than my android one that will continue video playback if i exit the video screen whenever i have my phone connected to the the tv with hdmi unfortunately it only plays it for 2 minutes then freezes my android player continues video playback whenever the phones connected to the tv with hdmi cable so im able to do anything else with my phone like browse text etc while watching a video from my phone onto my big screen this other video apps are just a waste : 

input: slowed down my nvidia shield tv to a snails pace upon first bootup as it decided to scan my two external drives automatically this is not how a media player should act instead a competent dev would give the option to manually designate folder pathways at the start of the app uninstalling vlc fixed my shield tv avoid this app and use mx player instead : 

input: we all know about vlc the legendary goto video player but please for the love of god dont limit subtitles to be rendered only on movie picture if the movie is higher than 169 and there are thick horizontal black lines above and below the picture please let us use it for subtitles same problem on pc for years now dont forcefittoinsidepicture the subtitles and dont scale them to max size of the picture use display resolution limits not the resolution of the videomovie : 

input: the app is ok but when i delete a song or video the title does not go away why its like it has thumbnails why i dont like that i expect that when i delete a song it should go away completely that is my problem with vlc also i cant create my own playlist  : 

input: suddenly after years of success with this app it randomly sometimes starts a song file by starting 2 seconds into the song but only playing a tenth of a second of it then blank space then picking back up 2 more seconds into the song whatever you idiots did to this app which was working just fine before your recent updates thanks i am now your biggest and most vocal critic i even factory reset my device and downloaded a fresh version on vlc player and yup same malfunction idiots : 

input: was a top notch until recently i have tons of music videos on my phone i love to chromecast but with recent updates now none of the vids will refresh and appear on vlc even after uninstalling and reinstallation and despite the fact the file folder is in the vlc video directory extremely frustrating i now use another player but will hang on to this app to see if an update will fix this issue otherwise this wont be of much use to me : 

input: update killed it videos will not play from where they left after switching screen off and on comes back only audio i was so happy to have found excellent functions at a player i ll downgrade if i can i m sure all will be fixed i ll raise 3 stars to 5 when done : 

input: im either a dinosaur or a snob with music i still carry a high resolution dedicated walkman to listen to i never use a phone for music today i tried putting an album on my phone to see if id like it after setting android and vlc settings to my liking the music sounds good but every time a new song starts it skips thats a deal breaker : 

input: this seems to have been going down hill over the last few versions i use this to listen to audio books and chose it over other free programs because it was a non profit which i admired but the main problem for me is that many audio books are a single file 10 hours or more in length and you will tend to pause the playback frequently with this app it loses its place every time you get a phone call it loses its place just when you open some apps it seems to lose its place sometimes just when the phone is charging and loses its place when the battery is low or the device powers off none of which is a problem it used to have in older versions where at the very least you would press play and it would start from where you started to play the file last time and as trying to go back and forth trying to find the point of the book you were up to in a 10 or 16 hour audio book on a 5 inch screen even in landscape is a frigging nightmare and when a book is split in chapters which can often be over 100 chapters and it forgets you have to play the first file then use the step forwards one file button because if you try to run the chapter you were up to it just plays that one chapter only : 

input: ill just give 2 starts not satisfied every time i play the vedio and clicked the subtitle will appeared at the first episode but when i play for the next ep the subtle of first ep will play on the second episode and its irritating ive tried to fix it but still wont work  : 

input: i love the app very much use it in all my devices however with huawei p20 lite the app constantly stops playing music whenever the display turns off and continues to play when display is on as a result as much i enjoy the app i had to uninstall cause i cannot and do not want to keep my devices display on all the time in order to enjoy my music : 

input: awesomeif u r a binge watcher this app is for youseriously it regroups your episodes fabulouslymust downloadbtw i have not been told by the app to ratei am rating it myselfedit its been a month or twoand there is a defect that it shows subtitles at the top and squeezed letterscorrect that and i will give you 5 again : 

input: the pc version of this app is powerful inarguably but this android version does not live up to its name it has lots of unnecessary features and makes it cluttered during video playback you notice your screen is filled with icons and stuff and that deep colour pfff : 

input: everything is good in vlc however id like one very important feature to be added vlc needs to let the user control the padding of subtitles in player 189 devices are very common now and some videos when zoomed to full screen start hiding the subtitles below the video making them not possible to view please please fix this : 

input: your apps was working perfectly until the newest update now i cant easily download subtitles anymore from the inapp settings : 

input: my issues are 1 the sorting of video list it should also have option to display videos in terms of folder video files of one folder is scattered around the entire list i tried all possible way but failed so vlc look for it and add option to sort by folder or folder view and arrange folder sequence manually 2 missing folder lock option 3 i also faced issue with downloads files names it shows website name instead of actual file names while mx player shows correct name for same files : 

input: i use vlc on both my chromebook and my imac love its ability to play odd file types that it goes and gets codecs it needs and how it can often fix a partially broken file that no other app will play when friends express frustration with other often native players i just tell them to download vlc and they are always glad they did i would like a little bit more ability to fast forward but i realize that depends on file type : 

input: pretty good except for the utterly useless media search space seems to be interpreted as or rather than and why stuff seems to match based on containing a substring within an edit distance and heaven help you if youre searching in japanese desktop has none of these problems what the hell : 

input: i have been trying to download subtitles for many movies its not working they will just show me that it has finished downloading but there is still no subtitles when you delete a video from your phone it wont delete from the vlc till you uninstall and reinstall again : 

input: i will change my rating to 5 stars once you fix the casting feature the cast button appears sporadically and at times is not available despite every other app in my phone being able to cast on the chromecast neflix youtube soundcloud mx player spotify google home are all able to cast but vlc wont show ke an option to do so considering i downloaded the application for casting this is not going so well : 

input: great except a few issues if you own a 3 band wifi router router asus 11000 w gigabit both up down network this app in a fast quality device like my samsung galaxy note 9 512gb 8gb ram this app still will not cast 4k video no matter how much ram device screen resolution cpu network speed settings in it i have so the app still needs a fair amount of work it is very good otherwise i use it quite a bit : 

input: after updating the the double tap for 10 seconds forward not working properly please check it it is very annoying  : 

input: i used to love this app and swore by it but recently ive had nothing but issues with casting videos it either stops or you lose the ui so cant control the vid : 

input: the vlc media player need to improve performance picture quality and sound quality was very poor : 

input: only app that plays hevch264h265 video streams flawlessly on a mediocre wifi connection for me tried bs mx player before but sftp does not work for me keeps asking for a password even though i entered one the correct one i triple checked my server config and it works except with vlc for android tested kodi windows macos thunar xfce file thingy please fix then 5 stars reply and i will give more details happy bug hunting thanks for showing blender shorts in the screenshots btw : 

input: i love this app and i continue to use it despite the glitch im about to describe however the glitch forces me to uninstall vlc for android until i need to use it because when i connect to a bluetooth device 4 audio it automatically loads and fails to connect to the video and continually pops up out of control once they fix that bug the app will be nearperfect i will note that it tries to play wifi networked videos through my 4g connection lol : 

input: vlc currently has a major issue on my fire tablet 8 where it frequently randomly pauses making it impossible to listen to music which is what i mainly use it for : 

input: last upgrade totally broke it only one song is detected app acting super random edit adding 1 star because unselecting the folders to scan and reselecting them made my tracks come back : 

input: great app but streaming from youtube broke recently it was a handy way to avoid ads share to vlc from the yt app so a fix would be greatly appreciated : 

input: been using this app for videos for years but the cast on it is terrible it will cast the video to my chrome cast but the video blanks after 2 minutes fix this and it would be a 5 again : 

input: couldnt access sd deletion     : 

input: overrated appyou cant download subtitleyou cant adjust subtitle can only watch vedio and thats all : 

input: cannot open after install      : 

input: very buggy when trying to stream from pc to phone cant remove the notification for a video playing despite swiping closed the app moving to any other app and back to the video ends the playback unless playing a playlist and it sometimes loads forever and freezes probably works find for playing videos directly from phone tho : 

input: i saw that the newest version targets android 90 and instantly thought id have to downgrade since every other app i use is forced to ignore the corners on devices with a notch leaving a useless black bar but i was pleasantly surprised to see that vlc still allows content to be displayed there in full screen mode : 

input: good application but you have reduce the sound volume remember the sound volume was 120 i think but now it is 100 only i ask for the initiators of this application to return on its former level of sound it was very fantastic but the application is really good i like it : 

input: playing video on my 6 3 inch screen in potrait mode caused vlcs navigation buttons overlapped by androids navigation buttons the 3 buttons at the bottom so im unable to use your buttons unless i rotate my screen to landscape hope a fix to this cause there are some videos that came in vertical mode : 

input: as a powerful video and audio player that exists as free and open source software i feel there are glitches occuring in the latest version that should be easily fixed audio muting after seek for example mobile lg g6 phone to be desired are more functions to modify layout as well as playback parameters : 

input: this app was previously good but now i dont know videos that i deleted are can still be seen in the app even when a refresh it it doesnt go and new videos that i expect it to appear are not found please fix this problem thank you : 

input: while i prefer the original on my computer this app version is pretty awesome as well my only problem is that itll randomly forget my place in the audiobooks i listen to its annoying i still prefer it to any other media player app for android : 

input: the app is good but it needs some improvements it doesnt have show by folder option in locks screen when you press pause and screen locks again for resuming again must unlock phone and open app again because controllers are gone it doesnt have choosing speed for player if they fix these i will give 5 star : 

input: just about every vehicle on earth allows you to adjust the balance therefore every audio application gets 1 star till they add a balancer nobody has perfect ears especially when it comes to centering the sound in the brain or what people call the inner ear balancing improves all sound especially vocals and enhances binaural beats to be more effective why is this no longer a setting on most phones either : 

input: cant find my videos and during watching the video its slightly uncomfortable request to dev that make it more user friendly and fun during video is playing help of some animations or something yeah for me its only like my old android stock video player instead of that it must have more features in now a days  : 

input: since the update the sleep timer no longer works and turning your phone on its side to make to time bar bigger no longer works either the app also does no save where you are in audio files so you have to start from the begging each time and try to find your place which use to be much easier when you could turn your phone and make the bar at the bottom bigger : 

input: hello to vlc thank you for this great app i use it to view my media via chromecast but there is un issue if i downloaded a subtitle from outside the app the subtitle wont show on the tv using chromecast i have chromecast 3 and its updated to the last version i really hope that you guys fix this problem thank you again  : 

input: love vlc desktop hate this app it has the same issues like other ones go to use the shuffle feature and it doesnt shuffle wont shuffle when i press the forward button on my car or from the widget it works half the time but samsung default app works fine and other devices dont have an issue problem is the default samsung app sucks for using it as a folder player and blacklisting certain folders : 

input: program is good for people without hearing problems for those of us not so lucky vlc contains a glitch that causes subtitle failure after pausing for a couple of minutes it is most disconcerting ive starting using a nonvideolan player : 

input: this app would have 5 stars from me if it wasnt for these issues that i find annoying sometimes the playlist disappears and you have to go off the app and back on it a few times for it to show up again i cant seem to stop time stretching even though the option is disabled sometimes the rewind button gets stuck and i have to restart the track remember playback position onoff makes no difference if i play a long track it will always remember where it left off and resume from there : 

input: dont get me wrong vlc is my favorite media player however one programmers shallow unimaginative lazy thinking can and very often does ruin a formerly excellent piece of software this versions utter obliviousness to the users need for the software to hold the users place in an 11hour file or 40item playlist eg for more than a few minutes pause is enough for me to abandon this technically far superior phone for one whose vlc version does not feature such forgetfulness : 

input: the ui is kinda fastpaced and desperately lacks explination a onetime help window isnt super helpful but its great for viewing videos sent over the internet without downloading them in full and i havent experienced any crashes with it at all has some problems with smooth looping and does a bunch of weird aspect ratio adjusting between every loop : 

input: everything works fine to a point the go back a track shortcut doesnt work on some versions of android because long press doesnt apparently get sent to the app sometimes a playlist will sort itself alphabetically in visuals only and it might only happen in dark mode there things are easy to work around though and in terms of actually playing media everything works perfectly fine : 

input: there is only one bug not sure if it is a bug or intentional making when i play the video in audio mode it starts from where i left off earlier which is good but when i keep it in loop one it again starts from the same place where it was expected to start from the beginning : 

input: i like vlc but the new version doesnt work well with my nas over smb i have dlink dns320l nas and after updating vlc nas appear in the list but i cant connect to it whats the problem with it : 

input: i have been an avid vlc user from pc to mobile since 2009 i will never use anything else for pc i would be just as adamant about the mobile version but there are a few hiccups since the last updates ive had to delete vlc and reinstall due to it stopping at random when playing music and distorted videos i also would like to be able to edit playlist orders reinstall seems to have fixed the stopping music problem on galaxy s9 : 

input: new interface r really bad it takes no of clicks for simple work while we want to change screen size of video : 

input: i dont know why but you can play any kind of video format in this : 

input: there is nothing to tell the app to just play it plays the same thing over and over the random play just plays the same group of songs or artists again and again used to be a good player years ago but used to be does not cut it this is a frustrating piece of garbage now just the same as all of the other players : 

input: vlc player app for android is good for playing videos and audio since it supports for all the formats though not supported by other app but only issue is with google chromecast streaming is ended after 5 and 7 minutes this has been reported in videolan website and most of the mentioned in review here but videolan hasnt given any fix or solution to this this is really a big concern for us : 

input: cant skip up a few seconds or drag it back a couple of minutes it plays fine but thats all : 

input: as im finding out i am not alone with this now non play issue vlc is now saying that one of my shared networks is asking for a password it cant be my network since there has never been a password set up for this particular one i have never needed anything of the sort before please correct this unsettling vlc mistake before i have need to look for another compatible app : 

input: apparently after latest vlc update my music wont scrobble to lastfm anymore though android version 10 could not go any worse but seems like some apps try to get on that pedestal : 

input: why cant i delete any video using the new vlc player for android it is difficult to just watch a video then go to the files to delete it then back to vlc i have a lot of clips and that style is rigid please correct that : 

input: latest update broke it it no longer plays my favorite avi files it is just a black screen with the spinning vlc logo : 

input: every thing is good but there is one issue with ts file streaming every time facing unseekable stream error : 

input: this app is okey but i couldnt download any subtitles : 

input: worst app in the world doesnt support 4k videos and it also black and stop sometimes it doesnt open even and it says that you cant install it in phone it doesnt support your phone dont install it ever in your entire life : 

input: the latest version is causing stability issue when using sleep function every time sleep function is used the app need to be stopped from apps notifications in settings area which is cumbersome also the thumbnails generated from old media that dod not exist currently are not being cleared automatically eating up free space : 

input: the only thing i have a complaint about is the eq ive always wished it had more frequency bands a 31 band eq would make this the greatest app howeverif you were to add at the very least 25hz 40hz 18khz and 20khz frequency bands in the next version that would be better thats at the bare min tho a full blown 31 band eq would be so much better and would be worth the effort ya vlc always has been a nice multi media player its come a long way especially on android but this is the biggest issue in my opinion for audio junkies such as my self : 

input: one of the best video player but with room of improvement it can be better if it has the option to categorise the videos by their original folders and currently the video player doesnt remember the sorting option it always back to name everytime closed and re open the app : 

input: recently i downloaded a video file however while playing the video on vlc a message is being displayed that xvid video codec is required for playing the file till now i was thinking that vlc us the most updated video player which have all the codecs and plays allmost all the files i request to add xvid video codec too for us users regards : 

input: please bring sort by new or sort by date modified back why has it been removed : 

input: with the new update clicking shuffle to play a random song pops up a loading message that takes 5 seconds to resolve before a song starts playing this is absurd given that im on a pixel 2 and have only about 3k songs and it was not true in the old version : 

input: great music and videos player if you dont have it get it now i do come across some bug when i hold the next buttons to seek through my music the app kinda just continues to press the button even after i stop pressing not many issues here : 

input: since the update on 20th march lots of individual songs have been moved out of their album entry into a separate identically named album under the same artist very frustrating and far too many to simply fix up by looking into the tags for each mp3 and fixing it up has happened throughout my large library seemingly at random : 

input: great video player for any format but why the one star because i just found out that it is the only app that has been going through my snapchat files old pictures off my sd memory card es file explorer tracks activity of files being created vlc has created its own folder with thumbnails of what it has been viewing im talking about pictures from 2 years ago which i havent bothered to open in the last week yet they manage to view them as well as saved snapchats recent and long ago : 

input: when playing longer mp3 files the app will constantly and annoyingly start from the middle of the track no way to fix it without reinstalling the app if vlc closes while playing there should be a dialog box asking if we want to start from where we left off or from the beginning of the track will uninstall completely if it keeps happening : 

input: i use vlc on a daily lately it has been weird everytime i am watching a movie on my android i go to another app then switch back to the movie it used to just keep playing from where i left it but now it comes back blank and then i have to find in the cue where i left it : 

input: this app is really good support variety of codec and a variety of container however i really hate the fact that we can play video from a archive like the pc version do : 

input: ive been loyal to vlc for over 10 years im very disappointed because of the lack of equaliser settings this is essential for a such a simple app im under the impression that it has been removed from previous versions im sadly switching away from vlc until they update with an equaliser : 

input: why you need to change something that was good even perfect before the new ui is horrible too big icons and you removed the most important icon from the ui the resize screen i know its there on the menu but hides half the screen when i try to calibrate the screen size i needed 3 tap before to start a video with perfect screensize even while was running now i need to lose precious time to watch anything and the time is money bring back the old ui this one is frustrating : 

input: this update cannot display playlist while video is playing unless you play the video in a sequence order please fix it : 

input: there are some videos that it cant play i have to use other players the codec needs updating : 

input: cant download subtitles even though there is an option for that keep hearing a beeping sound while the video is playing : 

input: this app is absolutely awful things im watching keep freezing every second i cannot find a decent app to watch tv shows on : 

input: ive used this app for quite a while now and loved it but the new update kind of destroyed everything when i open it the app automatically tilts everything to the side and i didnt find a setting to undo that and in general i just dont like the new look and how everything is set up and organized at all i had hoped i wouldnt have to look for another audio player anymore because vlc is so good but now i will probably have to : 

input: they should never had done this last update issues of display no possibility to delete videos with vlc anymore inferior design extremely bad update just erase this update and put the older version back : 

input: one great tool if you use it and think of it as the swiss army knife of media necessities you will not be disappointed you can stay as basic or go as deep as you need from my experience its not going to be as slick or pretty as some others but i have never had an issue with it or not been able to open a file i use another player exclusively for music and this for everything else and music as well sometimes have used it on desktop for years one of those apps i keep coming back to : 

input: stream features not working    : 

input: format not supported in app    : 

input: subtitles arent downloadable it should be fixed : 

input: the app keeps crashing or getting stuck randomly in the middle of some videos : 

input: so its relatively amazing video player though the only thing makes me lose my mind is that when i flip my galaxy s9 plus sideways the brightness goes down but the percentage stays at 100 and it makes me lose my hit its way darker even on 100 brightness at landscape mode i am opened for suggestions : 

input: extremely buggy when using chromecast you also cant turn off autorotate so youre definitely going to accidentally hit a button or find yourself in the middle of the movie on accident in general when using chromecast with this youll be faced with constant disruption : 

input: great on pc horrible on android doesnt support vast music extensions as it should every time it opens vlc requires an entire memory scan for media files and playing on shuffle is so cheaply programmed that it constantly loses its place when going forwardsbackwards from songs i would like to hear again : 

input: opened vlc started to play a video switched to another app audio is playing in the background good switched back to vlc video changed to audio i need to click the video button get the video back fix this if i switch to another app while playing a video i need to get the video back when i switch back to vlc thanks : 

input: you have to select one by one to add on the playlist extremely fiddely it shows annoying tips overlaying on top of the video and audio 10 sec everytime you open the file and there is no option to disable it stresses me out i am tired of using this app : 

input: it crashes my galaxy tab s2 ve 97 one time in three when casting to my chromecast it cause the device to restart but then doesnt detect the memory card it requires another full restart to detect the memory card its a real pain in the proverbial butt : 

input: its vlc of course its brilliant but ive switched phones to the one plus 6t and the app crashes to a black screen every time i minimise and then go back to it id have to restart the app and whatever it is that im watching from the beginning each time please fix this : 

input: its worst than the older onebefore the updated versioni can full control in my sd cardi can play audio and video directly from the vlc playerbut nowthe updated vlc player its not work properly and i cant explore me sd card from vlcand the vlc cant read my cardi like the orlder versionbut this version need some bug fixes and solve some issues : 

input: if your version of vlc is working do not update to this version i loved this app and used it for internet radio after the update it didnt find my media or playlists luckily the old app had an accurate history file so i was able to locateaccess my links the equilizer is gone also : 

input: i love vlc but atm the parsing system is not playing well with my essential phone after a few deletes of mp3s it doesnt recognize new or updated files i have to clear the app storage not the cache in order to fix the problem which ultimately resets my settings and i have to start a new : 

input: i really wanted to like this because ive used the pc version for 10 years but this app is honestly trash annoying unremovable splash tutorial every single time you open a filehaving to reapply subtitles every time you minimisevideo freezes and grey screen glitches for no apparent reasoncompletely unintuitive uiobnoxiously timeconsuming sliders for applying delayssyncs and the worst why does volume increase in increments of 6 and not 5 more than mildly infuriating avoid : 

input: there is a glitch when i use the screen mirroring feature it always starts blinking and does not connect i have to go back then try to play the movie again in order for it to work also it stops streaming on the screen mirroring any time i get a message or notification of any kind : 

input: overall an awesome app plays almost every type of media file great customization and functionality only thing that needs to be fixed and i hope the developers read this the sleep timer is no longer working app is installed on an s9 any suggestions : 

input: love it but since last update whenever i pause a video go to another app then come back it freezes i have to close the video and restart figure out where i was up to fix it and ill give you 5 starts thank you thought this update did it but still not : 

input: for years vlc has been my goto on phones and pcs alike but lately everytime i attempt to play a video from my samsung galaxy phone it shows the navigation arrows screen and shuts down never playing the video so i had to find another to try fix and i surely will reinstall : 

input: hi i always choose vlc as my go to app for playing movies however it now has some glitch with my new phone when i exit the app without closing it and i open my tabs again and try and open it it doesnt allow me to it just says vlcnis unable to open then i have to open the app all over again and search for the movie i was busy with i also have to forward to part where i was : 

input: used to work great then yesterday it would just keep stopping my playlists songs after a few seconds refuse to accept inputspauseplayetc from my bluetooth headphones and overall unresponsive switched to a different media player everything works just fine with that so it wasnt a phone or headphone issue : 

input: hands down own the best media player available i just wish the recent update hadnt removed the ability to keep the audio playing for popup player while my device is locked now if i want to see the video after unlocking the device i need to play as audio and open it from there a minor convenience in an otherwise excellent app : 

input: i like this app and would give it 5 stars but on my phone oneplus 5 i can clear a playlist and if i draw the unpause gesture on the screen while my phone sleeps it starts playing from the playlist that was cleared ive even cleared the play history and force closed the app and this still works its a deal breaker unfortunately but i would love to reinstall vlc if this gets fixed : 

input: there used to be a arrow like icon on the right hand side of vlc which was really helpful for casting the video on tv but no its not there what happened : 

input: 7i was just getting to my point when my rating was closedmy issue is that i dont want anybody access to mypersonal text or call if the access you require is for other reasons which i dont understand please someone explain to me how the access is used : 

input: app is great but it needs some improvement like if we play a song without enable time stretching audio and increase its playback speed then audio got destroyed and facing too many noise while playing audio improve it so that we can play song too in fast playback speed without changing pitch i hope you will be improve this as early as possible otherwise it deserve five star rating : 

input: no sync between audio and video in almost all videos and it happened only with the vlc app please fix this issue : 

input: oh my god this app saved me i just downloaded this 3 gb movie but mx player doesnt support its weird audio format so i downloaded vlc and now everythings fine thank you for this app : 

input: i loose my place in an album often after pausing it making this unsuitable for album listening which is the majority of what i use apps like this for : 

input: it started great at first but after 3 or so movies the subtitle wont sync with the video i tried reinstalling the app but it still wont work : 

input: i don t know but many people gets trouble with this app and this app totally working but this app have closed captional so : 

input: after the last update the application has become unusable when i turn on a movie mp4 in the vertical screen the navigation buttons eg play overlap the system buttons triangle circle and square and i cant stop the movie and use any other with five down buttons : 

input: simplly brilliant everything just works really well and beautifully too ive not yet found a file format it wont play it works well in the background audio fedelity seems good to my admittedly untrained ear no annoying advertising absolutely perfect : 

input: pretty unstable lately and buggy af every time i use it recently doesnt play well with some videos but the rest work fine need to be wary of which compression has been used on the video i guess shame it has bever been an issue before and vlc has been my go to player on most platforms for well over a decade : 

input: good job with a broken update now i can no longer cast to any devices which already was pretty sketchy to begin with also the app never seems to stay open in the background when media is paused regardless of power settings : 

input: not very stable on a road trip i was trying to play an audiobook mp3 version kept crashing and couldnt restart where it leftoff it only remembered the start of the audiobook not where it was when it crashed : 

input: works fine but since last update the speed adjustment is altered in such a way that it has become a little bit difficult to reach the option if you might wanna increase also one must re enter required speed each time he opens the app  : 

input: the beta was much better because you could speed up songs and heighten the pitch but this version just skips when you try to play it sped up how is the beta better than this version yet thats the one thats gets the plug pulled on it very disappointed : 

input: when i turn my phone to go from portrait view to landscape view video player goes into pip mode and restarts the video which is very irritating also the resume playback sometimes works sometimes not there is no option for folder view had very bad experience uninstalling : 

input: i cant play a video twice for the first time is ok but when i try to play the same video again it opens and closes the app fix it please but i like the features like controls the brightness in the screen : 

input: as functional as the original vlc so it is buggy but will play mostall video not necessarily completely correct includes new additional bugs and missing features special for android partially due to android broken joke casting is nonfunctional only able to use one screen making in video menus useless : 

input: video does not play when i switch back to the app from exiting this does not happen prior the recent update i have been using vlc for a long time and this is the first time i have experienced problems with this app : 

input: is there a way to build a playlist in vlc without having to play each song or video am i missing something would be great to have option buttons in the playlist and search views to put put them into playlists queues or even play next also ab playback doesnt work other notifications cancel vlc playback though keeps playing thank you for making vlc on android however it is frustrating to use until fixed : 

input: best player full stop my only gripe is that i cannot get it to function with android auto no matter what build of the app i use i heard functionality was supposed to come back in 31 apparently not will give 5 stars if an answer is given : 

input: when playing video as audio in the background the app will frequently lose the audio file when app is reopened with the file needing to be opened again from another app in this case evernote and started from scratch again very frustrating when trying to take notes from lecturesrecordings which involves flicking between vlc and other apps : 

input: i dont know whats wrong with this app ive been using it for many years no issues and then out of the blue the last couple of months it just started deleting pictures videos music rearranging it i use showbox and for some reason it deleted about 20 videos today but now i cant find or use and i try to download it again and it wont even show it : 

input: its a pretty decent app i like a lot of its functions but it pisses me off a lot too like it will stay on my bar like i have something plaing when i dont even when i remove the notification or the worst and most annoying thing is if i leave the app and have it play in the background if i press play again it will send me to a completely different file and video and if i go back to the video i was watching even if i was like halfway through and have the setting that saves the time it restarts : 

input: worse than kodi unable to maintain a consistent framerate discards arbitrary key frames leaving badly corrupted video unusually poor performance for 16bit ycbcr 444 1080p : 

input: there is a lack of subtitle options im not looking for anything crazy but i couldnt even change the size i know there is a size option but it didnt do the trick mx players scaling option worked fine not to mention they have way more subtitle options : 

input: the latest update ruined everything it takes way too long to load and ends up making my phone lag please fix it : 

input: used to work great now with android 90 seeking immediately crashes the video stream making it unusable : 

input: well now i cant save or see my equalizer presets there is no number representing were slider is it just says 20db across the whole spectrum otherwise its always been a good app : 

input: good bt cant play in background : 

input: it is absolutely perfect but the problem is that why dont you put dark mode : 

input: very good but one problem i cant return to the app if i moved from it in a middle of a movie : 

input: its alright but im trying to get it to work with some homework i have been sent its a video and i now cant watch it because this is glitching out otherwise great app : 

input: i will change my rating if you fix this issue after the most recent update the app no longer opens on my galaxy j4 core : 

input: this app was really good last year im not sure if its the new phone emui os android pie or an update but the picture in picture has gone crazy buggy and the video will skip back a few seconds or to the beginning when rotating its difficult to use now : 

input: i love this app watching my shows on it they look better best of all the app plays them in order no more exiting and clicking on the next episode i almost didnt get it what a mistake that would have been  : 

input: was really enjoying using this but recently videos that ive tried to play have just been freezing with the audio still playing no its not the files fault and sometimes it forgets my place in the video im watching if i pause it for too long better than my inbuilt video player but certainly has some issues : 

input: a few changes were made recently and its definitely throwing me off playlists are in their own separate section but i can get used to it it annoys me that i cant reorder songs in a premade playlist though : 

input: if you minimize the application to read messages or even if you turn the display of and off the application yill keep closing itself until you restart the phone its a shame because its the only app that plays really any video : 

input: very poor performance inconsistent results frequent disconnections frustrating and cumbersome this app is equally as bad as the desktop version is good search for other methods do not use this app : 

input: its good that it plays soft subs but theres a time that when i download a new movie or video it aint refreshing the library and the old videos that are deleted are still there please fix your app : 

input: sleep timer broken since you changed from the popup icons to a list menu please fix it edit kinda works now but its buggy if player is stopped by sleep timer you have to force close vlc to play anything again also would be nice to see how long is left on the timer either by notification or in the menu as it did previously : 

input: stopped crashing when changing screen orientation good and now subtitles dont load anymore even when they are in the same folder than the movie another regression in a series of regressions after years without bumps whats happening  : 

input: would have given it a 5 star rating until the last video i tried to play on it wouldnt play the screen would just flash and then go back to main screen i had to use another app just to play itthe pc version has always supported every video format so this is a big disappointment for me : 

input: something is really weird about the audio and picture sync when bluetooth headphones are used the subtitle overlaid would sync perfectly but the picture may be 10ms faster than both the audio and the subtitle if would have made more sense if the subtitle and thr picture is in sync  : 

input: gr8 application after checking lots of things i found out 2 flaws 1 cant adjust video per second ie minimum 3 second change is given its ok to adjust 1 second change 2 the equlizer is out of date improve that xplayer can beat you in equlizer you guys do beat them in audio but not video : 

input: great sound quality smooth interface best all around music media player on the app store only complaint is that every once in a while it parses for media way too long i have over 32gb of music so maybe its my faultbut very annoying : 

input: works better on chromecast a google product than google play music which requires that you first upload your mp3s works better at bluetooth audio than google play music because i always have to manually kickstart google play music to start playing less bloated than other players : 

input: would be amazing but this app seems to have issues with displaying shared media files from my pc my pc will have x amount of files in a single shared folder but vlc will only show half of them not much i can do within vlc app since the options are so barebones please fix this issue its the same issue with the other green version of vlc : 

input: the deleted music files still show up in the vlc song list it shows deleted when i try to play it though refreshing the list also doesnt help new files also dont show up in the list sometimes i have to browse the directory to play it : 

input: app only plays audio for 30 or so seconds when in the background or when the screen is locked pretty annoying if i am wanting to browse other apps while listening to music is there a fix for this issue i can only see settings for background video playback which isnt what i am after : 

input: the audio and video files stored on my sd card do not show in the media library even though the location folders are selected whats good though is that i can put the folders in the directories tab so i could easily access it but still i hope my media files on the sd card get recognized automatically : 

input: media library nightmare used to love this app it can never find my music its laggy its a pain i preferred it over google play i stopped using itbecause its always brokenworks a week so i switch from playcreate my playlists againand broke after another week what a shameused to be amazing save yourself a huge headache this thing needs rewrote : 

input: its playing a video that my samsung video player wouldnt load its awesome no one wants to download a torrent file n not be able to play it after the effort only struggle is my brightness cant be altered on the video thats a bit annoying because i need to find a dark cupboard to watch it in : 

input: i have vlc for many computers and it works great on the phone not so much it just keeps crashing most of the time rarely working though it also plays my avi files the crashing has got to be fixed asap even restarting my phone did not fix the problem : 

input: the latest version sucked to put it simply v4x not only does not refresh the list even if iss done manually i would end up losing all my videos thumbnails as well the only way to fix it is to go back to v231 or earlier oh how i longed for provision of no stars at all if there is such a thing : 

input: this app is killing my phone when i open vlc it start for scanning for media files i cant stop this scanning and my phone hanged and restart each time when i open this app and watch a movie i only tried 3 times my phone hanged like it is infected with a wrost virus i played pubg and other games but i never feel a lag before i am using honor 8x i used vlc before i never feel anything like this if i download this from some where else i would really think it is dangerous virus : 

input: i am loving this app because it plays all sorts of video formats available on the internet but i would five it 3 as while playing some content which has been saved in a location and i dont open that content from gallery or dile explorer or if i get a call there are no resume capabilities and i have to start it again : 

input: vlc has been my goto video player for years but recently ive encountered severe audio stuttering from the video i downloaded from my car dashcam mov format to show to authorities i tried playing it on other android media player app and it was just fine good thing i had it as a backup please fix the audio stuttering : 

input: i really like the app but there is no function to let the video autoplay from the last video in the app back to the first video it is really disappointing as i thought this app can do what other apps cant until the issue is fixed my rating will stay 1 for now : 

input: great player smooth ui and allows screen off during chromecast to conserve some battery had to update this review since finding an issue vlc will not find new videos even after pull down and tapping refresh from top corner all other players such as mx xplayer and stock samsung video player all update and show new video just fine so it must be a glitch on vlc : 

input: the new update removed all the sorting features sorting by name descending or ascending when looking through all my recorded videos doesnt help me at all i renamed all my old ones with one or two words to remind me of what they were but i need chronological sort so i can get to my lab videos quicker on my biweekly updates : 

input: used to be a great app now after a fresh install under android 80 music keeps in shutting off on unpredictable intervals all of the latest updates are installed on windows on a desktop machine its the same flickering video what are you doing : 

input: too many ads never had ads before this is awful going to have to find another player this is the worst its not even worth one star : 

input: sometimes the downloaded subtitles dont fit correctly in movie even i adjusted the subtitle delay i reach 1200 ms still doesnt fit correctly : 

input: the app still cant play a cue sheet accompanying a wav file it shows the list of songs but no matter which song you click on it starts over from the beginning of wav next track does nothing and previous track starts from the beginning of track one as well the standard vlc media player for windows handles it fine : 

input: better but navigation and playback style is not that much attractive : 

input: terrible cant sort by date so i clear data cache and then reinstall tell it to not scan sd card but it scans it anyways what is this : 

input: this app is great but it needs some fixing when i played tokyo ghoul hd in it it just glitches : 

input: it was a fantastic platform for my use at the gym teaching classes but vlc continues to delete my playlists and rearrange songs in my playlists i cant rearrange the songs in my playlists this app wont sync soundtracks to the videos nice 15 sec delay this is now a serious problem for vlc you lost my trust my endorsement im quite happy to let my aquaintsesclients know how dissatisfied i am currently searching for a better reliable app worthless : 

input: the app is so boring when it comes to tracks name i have an audio track in my device and it have its name but i tried to search it in the player the player didnt find it i came to realize it is written track 4 while i know ut exact name fix this or you add a section to edit tracks details : 

input: this is my media player of choice and has been for years but now for some reason when getting out of the app now there is loading notification that doesnt go away unless you completely shut down the app which is a liitle annoying would normally give 5 stars : 

input: amazing video and music player that as a result of it having a fair amount of customisability and enabling users to have a significant freedom in what they do it has now replaced samsung music and the samsung video player which have in time degraded to a cluster of inconsistency and annoyance meanwhile making me wait for their terrible index update scheduel to be able to access my content : 

input: vlc is already an established name for video players and i like the wide customization options i just hope it saves the sort settings i set and not have to constantly change whenever i open it it really gets annoying over time can we also have a version that is just solely for videos and no music player i find the music player unnecessary and just taking up large storage : 

input: i have used this for a long time and wont use it again too many times it jumps the volume to the loudest setting even if i dont touch the volume button no matter what i do or how i set the app or my computer its been responsible for too many head akes : 

input: this is still the best player i use on pc now on my galaxy s10 plus chromecast is a breeze no adds etc plays off the otg just great no need for other playersthere really isnt question vlc does it play h265 had a bit of trouble i know it plays h264 if not please update all formats as this player is just the best bless ya helena xo : 

input: this app is nice except for one anoying thing when im enjoying my song if a call comes in the app stops the music and it doesnt resume the song after the call and it doesnt allow you to continue the song after the call the app shuts down : 

input: it used to work well before but now days it has numerous flawsit fails to update the latest movies when downloaded or acquired it doesnt delete movies completely promotes cluttering one has to delete and download a frsh for it to function normally : 

input: i love this app best android video player been using it since my first android experience i just have few tips 1please add sort by date to videos 2 subtitles files dont work often 3 albums category in music should add the tracks to their own album not separated that i find hundreds of albums 4some mkv videos might crash and result to not being able to play them ever again unless i reset the app cache : 

input: when i pause the video and lock the screen and restart it again theres no sound dosnt load subtitles from streaming apps auto subtitles search is broken when i start streaming or watching local video the player always starts with 0 brightness even if its not showing zero the screen is at its darkest i have to adjust it every time i start the player dosnt play some video formats i use this player now only cause this one can fill my entire screen unlike mx player : 

input: works well for the most part but its very difficult to make playlists and sort music within them appending works for the current session but sometimes want playlists that i can go back to : 

input: one of the few video apps on the google play store which is actually has good user interface and supports playing many video formats the only issue i have is i cannot disable the music player part of the app which sometimes launches itself when i want to play my music through poweramp : 

input: worthless pos has gone downhill with every update looses place and requires reloading the file if the audio is paused for any length of time landscape mode no longer has the ability to use the full screen for more accurate time scrolling findings are consistent on two tab s4s note 8 note 9 and a tab s2 : 

input: your app use to be good until your last update now it wont read all the music that it did before wont read any new music uploaded or ive chosen for playlist hell it basically does whatever it wants will be looking for a new media player : 

input: was a wonderful audio player but has been updated to no longer be useful for me pausing for almost any length of time will lose your place and reset the player so youll need to hunt down where you were listening from horrible if you listen to podcasts or audiobooks : 

input: make the album art uncut from above and bottom for a square picture cut in rectangular looks really bad fix the bug that sometimes turns off songs fix the bug that the scanning process starts too often up to 3 times a day and takes really long : 

input: since this last update i havent been able to play a single track no thats not quite right i havent been able to play more than 00000000001 of a single track im not ready to delete the app yet as im hoping you all will resolve these issues but this sucks because this is the only media app that ive used for years : 

input: its a great app but there are two big issues for me the first is that when using chromecast you cant put subtitles the second one its pretty recent for some reason they removed the ability to close the app from the lock screen quick menu : 

input: the latest update has made this app very slow and annoying scanning for music now takes forever the app hangs it very sad because ive loved vlc and used it for a long time i especially liked that it played practically all formats im disappointed and i had to change my music player : 

input: good but there are still a lot of fix needed i have new videos i download on my phone but it does not show in vlc even after refreshing it it does not show my new videos which is very annoying you guys need to fix it i switched to mx player today so until you guys fix your app aint gonna use it : 

input: the chromecast feature for vlc is awesome but cuts media of frequently otherwise a clean interface also no support for subtitles : 

input: does not work with oppo reno z in portrait mode the taskbar of the phone is on top of the play playback forward buttons of vlc it rotates movies even when my rotation on phone is turned off so does the phones own software which i dont want love the app for pc though : 

input: i downloaded this app because my new phones app does not support wma filesfor years i have spent my hard earned money lovingly collecting my favourite albums and now i cant listen to 90 of my music collectionthis app works fine exceptthe sound during playback speakers and headphones comes in pulsesthe sound decreases and increases again to the normal levels at regular pulsing intervals throughout the songon any wma file mp3 files are not affectedi tried reinstallingno good : 

input: buggy the swipe skip sometimes not working properly if i quit the app while in a folder then back again itll show the apps home screen but actually inside a folder so it confuses me every time because i cant touch anything and realized i was actually in a folder that the screen didnt show so i have to press back and then open the folder again so it showing properly idk if it was my phone but i think its not : 

input: vlc works fantastic even tho i have a default video player built in i prefer to use this application cuz of touch gestures from skipping fast forwarding volume and brightness is an amazing control it even support dark modebeen using it for years and id have to say its an amazing application im on a 64bit device and i found out in settings it was only on 16bit so that the video quality is a little washed out or low quality but faster in skipping i hope u optimize it for 64bit device s : 

input: crashes nightly while casting multiple videos to chromecast tv ive switched to mx player and i couldnt be happier : 

input: normally great the last update wont allow to delete a file directly from the app please fix : 

input: best video and music player only theres bug in subtitle when i go away from my mobile and return to it click subtitle button download subtitle doesnt work correctly i hope to fix it as soon as possible : 

input: again and again different song icon get shown on other songs and we have to then rescan it again and againthis issue has not been fixed in any of the updates of vlc : 

input: the app need to be subtitle oriented : 

input: it is good easier to create different playlists but i was not able to share the music directly from this app  : 

input: worked on different phones with newer versions of android doesnt work with 412 or smth on my samsung xcover 2 : 

input: love the app but mine doesnt download subtitle at all you guys need work on the subtitle aspect of the app to automatically search for subtle : 

input: i am using this app from 2 years and i think from two years i havent got any problem from it and in future i hope will be better  : 

input: not support for zte spro2 it install successfully but cant run : 

input: good app but i cannot covert the file vob to mp4 like what the app vlc in my laptop did : 

input: i liked the app but it lacks the option to change pitch of any musicmovievideo : 

input: i would have given 5 stars but something is wrong since a few days if i pause the video or pause and lock too and if i have to check anything else on phone messagemail and when you return back to the player it crashes there is a blank black screen instead of vlc : 

input: i love the app until i have to delete something to make some space then it wont let me delete files unless i uninstall the app it also crashing a decent amount not enough to stop using it but enough for it to be annoying : 

input: i havent used it locally very much as yet but it appears to be a little unstable when casting to chromecast throws up the occasional message about the file not being found i then have to close and reopen to get it to work again when its working its a great app : 

input: love being able to access media on other computers in the home only problem is i constantly have a spinning pylon in the middle of the screen hopefully the newest update will fix that because i have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling to get rid of it : 

input: i use the app to play background music while i read on my phone but recently it started closing and not staying open in the background after a bit its been happening at the least the past couple of days maybe week or bit more i dont know why also the stream feature needs some work it keep lagging buffer and dropping when i can play streams normally also if it play twitch that be cool : 

input: its a good player but having no option to turn off auto rotation its a problem for me to watch videos while laying on bed on one side which rotate the video and its like headache locking and unlocking the screen to watch videos in way i wanted i dont want auto roation : 

input: good overall experience so far but please it cant add any subtitles to the ts files the option is greyed out please fix this on desktop whatever the file extension is it plays and you can add a subtitle please fix this : 

input: glitchy at best get a call loose your spot and it restarts a couple of songs ago or chapters if listening to books will start up randomly if left in background trying to save your spot wouldnt use if i could find something else to play real media files also makes up title names if there to long : 

input: i really like the windows version however with the android version i can see thumbnail pictures of the video file but i cant get vlc to play any video only audio checking on the internet i see other people also have the same problem no solution though : 

input: no support for the latest smb protocols is a dealbreaker im not going to leave my pc vulnerable just to use vlc to access music on it remotely which is kind of a big part of the application for me shame because its otherwise good : 

input: not bad but when i delete a song from memory it still has its content but show file has been deleted and i cant happen to remove that and so i have uninstall and install every time like 3 times a month or so please help us remove this big bug : 

input: was 5 stars till you morons messed it up with last updateive used vlc for years loved the appnow looses my musiclocks up wont do anything unless i restart my phonewhat ever you did totally destroyed a great appnow i have to find one that works thanks for previous great app your update sucks and who ever wrote it should be kicked in the nutz : 

input: normally a very awesome app but for the android version it only understands files to play not dvds anymore last time it barely could recognize that it was a dvd to play not a file and now it flatly refuses to treat dvds as anything other than data files dang : 

input: great app used for years however through out the years resume playback has always had issues itll work for weeks on end then up and quit working for who knows how long and restart the file at the beginning for both audio and video : 

input: i am extremely disappointed in vlc ive been using it for sometime and lately the audio has become distorted and to make sure it isnt my phones speakers i also tried playing the same video from browser its a shame how it turned out to be i really liked it well all good things do come to end sooner or later : 

input: the app is decent but theyve made some lateral moves my biggest complaint is the removal of the resume button this feature was crucial for listening to audiobooks on my phone i really really hope they add this feature back in a future update : 

input: good media player one issue though when i try to play flac audio files they dont show up directly from within the app when i go to the folder in the app but im able to go to the same file in my file manager load vlc player through the file manager and play these flac files : 

input: this really is 1st top best music player in the world and its vlc due to updates of gplay music i cant scan my music anymore because all permissions are directed to the new system of 51 and up kitkat without the latest 64 capabilities doesnt have the ability to give permission to media filesstorage i am using samsung gtab 96e i was in a slump tried every mp3players out there and nothing really works i also used vlc in my desktop and its a wonderful player for my everyday playlists : 

input: it is possible to have an option on the very beginning to dismiss all the mandatory tutorials everywhere in the app for ever its quite annoying when i just installing stuff into my nth phone or replacing the os third time a day reinstalling vlc then whereever i click i got a random fullscreen do you know instead of my music thanks of course five stars because its vlc : 

input: this app was great but unfortunately there is only one dissapointment for me is when i seek a part of video sometime the sound frequency kinda worst decrease and increase and make the sound becomes bad and so unenjoyable to hear and watch some music video i guess this app need to be fixed from the sound frequency problem when u seeking the part of video : 

input: highly disappointed in this latest update please rollback to previous update hate how it lists the videos now no option to delete no button to change aspect ratio : 

input: the wiget finally works for me the app no longer seems to need to find my music files stored on my sd card before playing them everytime i start the app at least that was the case the day of the update a day ago now the app wont find the music on my sd card so now this app is useless for me : 

input: automatic subtitles download doesnt work anymore and hasnt been in a few months tbh also if you close the app and then try to come back it crashes and then you have to reset the video and try to find where you left off manually used to be great tho : 

input: just switched from a galaxy s7 edge to a pixel 3 xl honestly didnt realize how much functionality i lost from samsungs ui to stock android but the worst thing was that a lot of my music files were either missing info or album art or straightup couldnt play consistently on hash music player or google play music though the ui could use some work as far as playlist creation goes bulk adding songs to playlists would be nice only this app consistently played all my songsshowed all info : 

input: i dont want moving titles of videos highly annoying and cannot properly watch episodes names and double tap to move ten seconds show huge curve black effects please fix this : 

input: this version have problems srt subtitles are not working well unlike the previous versions : 

input: i will always love vlc please stop the banner runs theyre very confusing absolutely awesome feature but its very confusing : 

input: no longer opens                : 

input: i am beginning to have 2nd thoughts about this application there is no option to clear history of previous songs from screen you clear individual songs but they reappear again no option for multiple clearing either pls fix this : 

input: great app love it but when i use vlc to delete a video from my phone it still shows in my library rescanning my phone still leaves it there the only way to get it to disappear is to wipe the data of the app and scan again : 

input: perfect except for one thing the subtitle delay changes by only 50ms when you press the buttons so if you want to change 20 seconds you need to click 400 times and that is very annoying on my remote control for my android tv please fix this : 

input: just upgraded it and the whole good experience i had with it turned worse i cant help it but to delete though i have invested a lot of time and money on the game but why will a person turned a once beautiful animated game into an ancient arcade animation all in the name of upgrade i want refunds : 

input: this update broke the player its slow doesnt load files properly and the rss stream is not working at all anymore the only reason i have vlc is to stream podcast and now i cant was working great but not anymore after update fix and ill give 5 stars : 

input: i like it but it does not play all my music when i select certain songs to play after a few seconds it will skip to a different song with no explanation i wish it would at least tell me why it cant play the song : 

input: great media player but the chromecast feature is really buggy more often than not the icon doesnt even appear to allow casting all my other apps are casting fine so it isnt a fault on my end will happily give 5 stars if this gets fixed : 

input: good app till the new update when everything moved and now i have to go searching through the files and app to find most of my music which is stored on an sd card i cant access any of them from the opening screen albumtrackartistgenre which is making the app frustrating to use : 

input: it plays all videos but stability is awful phone slows and freezes because app crashes a lot i have used this for years its always had issues like the one i described auto rotate is a fail also it doesnt match your phones setting does anybody even read these reviews : 

input: used to be a great app one day it stopped being able to see videos on my phone ive reinstalled it maybe half a dozen times in the last six months and it always gets stuck on parsing media 17 how do i give negative stars : 

input: such a frustrating app to use sometimes it works great and sometimes well be halfway through streaming something to chromecast and it will start getting glitchy then give up altogether and you cant even get it working again after that so annoying : 

input: its a nice music app but its so annoying now i have uninstall the app just so my new music can be read by it there are times where when i hit shuffle it shows only 6 songs on my playlist when i have over 400 these glitches need to be fixed asap : 

input: been using this app for a very2 long time and is very helpful too id still say its the best media player but latest update sucks videos wont work on split screen anymore volume wouldnt go beyond 100 anymore and app crashes a lot more than before : 

input: it plays a lot of media unfortunately when playing music and leave it in background it will not remember the last played song or folder you must select again and again even if you do not actually close the app annoying great equaliser though : 

input: new update is awful the app became very unstable i frequently encounter gliches and bugs its almost impossible during playback to put the app into background and come back i always encounter blank black screen and have to restart vlc : 

input: the new version is bad for notched devices unlike the previous version this version also uses the space behind the notch meaning some contents of the video is hidden by the notch the previous version is way better cause it blacks out the notch : 

input: you have the best player for android no doubt here i found a peculiar bug though if one deletes the video and then starts other stream becomes unseeqable and app nonresponsive please investigate if its not planned behavior 5 stars anyway : 

input: vlc does not or cannot cast to audioonly devices with ones own local network namely to yamaha rn803 musicast linksys range extenders with analog audio ports re65006700 whereas its competitors neutronmp allconnecthifi cast can cast to both videoaudio receiving devices i was informed by vlc engineers that vlc will not have any plans to support casting to audio only devices other than chromecast audio which itself has problems if there is no internet connection not universal after all : 

input: screen dims automatically after 5 seconds or so its annoying as hell especially when its the only problem cant you fix it its needs to be fixed asap otherwise its very much near perfect for what it does again the automatic screen dimming pisses me off : 

input: the audio player doesnt work properly in my phone open sl es i mean i have flac tracks but i couldnt enjoy them because i frequently find artifacts quality is good and the flacs are authentic but i get these annoying artifacts thats it want you to fix it please humble request otherwise the apps is spectacular : 

input: vlc does it all and handles my very large collection of ripped music cds with ease i use it almost daily to play music over bluetooth in my car pauses automatically when i get out and starts playing again automatically when i get back in phone never even comes out of my pocket : 

input: using your finger to swipe through timeline is dumb everytime i wanna check my status bar it scans the video the lock feature is a pain to keep turning on and off should have option to use only a traditional slide bar instead and now adds popping up its time for me to move on i remember when free really did mean free : 

input: pls insert the language changeing options very worst compare to mx player : 

input: the old ui was much better and the new version is very buggy : 

input: the update ruined the app after the app got updated i now have a problem where not all my files load and that was never a problem i had before the update : 

input: why is it that everytime i update vlc its even more buggy : 

input: why is vlc for android taking so long to be downloaded but keep on reading : 

input: would have given 5 star but the app doesnt play mkv videos in slanted mode especially when subtitle folder is added once the subtitle is disabled it begins to play perfectly in slanted mode please look into this noriced it after last upsates abd thus happens on andriod 9 : 

input: its good but i have this issue with it where the media files i delete still appear as undeleted in the vlc app and only in the app whereas i cannot find them anywhere else and when i press on these files they appear as corrupted and i cannot delete these files in vlc as they specify some error and comeback : 

input: literally the only music player on the store that does what i needed 55 : 

input: the way the internal storage videos is shown is really bad the list viewing of videos of mx player is best so please the listing of media on the phone folder wise as it is in mx player otherwise player is good but needs improvement in hardware decoding : 

input: this is my fave app when playingwatching videosthe only thing i dont like about this is how the videos are arrangedwhen i download my fave episodes they are numberedi just dont like that after number 1 comes 11 next to it isnt it supposed to be 2 or is there a way i can change this : 

input: one of the best video players in the market but i am having trouble with the cast button it appears randomly i have to activate chromecast home or youtube cast in the app then disconnect for the cast button to appear in vlc couldnt you just put the button to be always present or a option in the settings to turn it on manually also dislike i have to confirm delete : 

input: its ok the video takes a second to find itself when you scrub ahead a few seconds and the screen starts off black everytime i play a new video a great app on my desktop but not a fan of the mobile version : 

input: ive used vlc as my go to on mac pc and mobile for years but suddenly on android unusable if i have to switch apps or pause anything it simply freezes cant open anything cant continue watching only option is to close and try to find where i was before shame : 

input: everytime i add new songs in storage it fails to find the new files it sort of pretends to search when i touch refresh until i uninstall vlc and reinstall it fortunately rocket player doesnt have this problem so ill be using that for music as it is the best android player at present : 

input: ridiculous takes loooong time to check for new files in library and when it does it shows file download source as file name i have so many movies and hence it is impossible to check which is the file i am looking for : 

input: always been a vlc fan the codecs user interface experience sound and equalizer controls playlist management instant brightness and volume control by quick touch response but i found one problem on huawei phones the ability to have functional control on the lock screen : 

input: still the best free media player on playstore tried all the others they all spam you with ads and fake updates which are just excuses to load the app with even more ads vlc plays everything is easy to use and is the only free media player on playstore without ads : 

input: just fix the old version and stop messing with it you keep damaging the app by adding features it was all ready the best a very long time ago stop making useless updates that cause malfunctions if not fixed really soon im getting rid of vlc from all my phones computers laptops and tablets like a lot of others are starting to because of your stupid changes and iv bin using vlc for well over a decade i do not want to have to start using another app and forget about any more donations : 

input: used to be the best player around but with the recent updates it just fails to play fullscreen due to some error in the way they have implemented fragments if you have an older version keep it untill the issue is fixed : 

input: like the interface but 2 problems 1 it keeps forgetting the contents of my playlists and they take an age to create so its very frustrating 2 it doesnt seem to be possible to reorder a playlist : 

input: audio delay was the big standout feature for me it is missing after update we could match words to the people speaking but not now maybe we could have that back great app : 

input: after the update interface usability downgraded decoding acceleration lags does not remember the last position of playback and audio streamsubtitles chosen screenfit bugs the app works significantly worse even though i did not change any applications system preferences in android  : 

input: i just have updated the app but when i search for my playlist i get a notification as vlc has stopped i need a solution immediately there is another problem as when i transfer some audio files in my phone the vlc dont show them untill i reinstall the app i need solution fir both problems  : 

input: awesome for listening to transferred old cd and tape recorder music 4 stars because it doesnt support reading aiff metadata so songs dont populate by album or artist even if the files contain that information otherwise this is hands down the best app no ads : 

input: good but if you delete a file on your device vlc still keeps file in the app and does not let you remove from library even though the file no longer exists aside from this odd issue it is perfect i had to clear the cache and so on for it to go away : 

input: ive rated this low as recent updates have broken basic funtionality play and pause really slow playlist cannot be ordered and adding doesnt always go to end worst of all selecting song in directories sometimes plays wrong song there are many more problems and no way to report them unless you are a software developer : 

input: it has everything id ever need you can change the speed if play equalizer you can move audio if its playing too late or soon same with subs and many more functions since the last update the playback speed always resets to x1 after i close the app its a bother to manually set it everytime : 

input: its open source and can play anything but it doesnt do any of that particularly well of the 3 media players on my phone it is by far the least reliable and most buggy it absolutely refuses to use subtitle files correctly or even at all sometimes : 

input: i am glad it can play mkv files as thats the only reason i needed video player app however after a 20minute episode my phone temperature was the same as when its charging with supercharger definitely not normal : 

input: hate the fact i cant turn it off when bluetooth connects it just plays and its not accessable to stop it so annoying every time this should be a toggle option i had to uninstall even though i love all the rest of it : 

input: hello vlc why why why have you made it so difficult to find the equaliser i used to really enjoy this app i even use it on a pc i hate it now on android because i get so annoyed because i cannot find the damn equalizer it used to be right there but you guys moved it and hidden it and i dont know why what is the point to it well you please correct the equalizer problem and have a icon for the equalizer on every page thank you and then ill give you full five star review : 

input: doesnt play files from the beginning confirmation to resume from last position doesnt work either very annoying constantly have to stop what im doing and restart the song hopefully this can be fixed in future updates : 

input: thanks for the update but still crashes after sleep mode and can not delete a filecached data until the app is reinstalled or refreshed numerous times could you add some radio and upnp dlna google cast is just not stable for us techy would rather support vlc than other fancy wannabes cant send music to network renderers cheers  : 

input: how do you stop the titles from scrolling whos the vagenius that came up with that idea terrible when looking for file names : 

input: you really screwed up this time i cant see my list of videos on home screen now even when i found them in directories folder they still dont show on lists : 

input: it is the best apk for android in the case of listening to music and watching videos or movies it has one or two bugs but it doesnt effect the application that much : 

input: its been awsome so far with no glitchs :

input: this app displays subtitles above the movie played and they are so small and stretched that i cannot understand anything thought this would be as good as the pc version but the bottom line is that its not : 

input: vlc is a good one but for the past two weeks im unable to play the videos which was played before in vlc same video are not opening again we are pushed to use another player for playing for that reason i have uninstalled the vlc : 

input: vlc used to be great but now im having trouble in downloading subtitles for my movies it always says service unavailable even though i have internet connection i tried restarting my phone but it doesnt work any suggestions : 

input: this apps playet is good if not one of the best in android you can change audio and subtitle tracks and change the aspect ratio overall pretty good but why is it that the ios version supports cloud streaming and the android version not you need to change that : 

input: after the latest update twitching videos on my s10 are gone great job but if we switch between apps or lock the screen my subs disappear and adding them manually doesnt work it takes a restart of the app to bring them back nevertheless 5 stars : 

input: vlc the best way to watch videos but if you click on the home button accidentally or any other reason the video you are watching it does not continues it starts from the beginning and thats annoying need an update  : 

input: very bad experience the pc version is much better than this app so many bugs and issues that i cant even write them all well i use vlc on my pc since last 7 years but cant use this app even for an hour  : 

input: doesnt handle multiple folders well random play aka shuffle is very poor it will play more than 2 songs from the same artist when there are numerous is biased towards folders that have already played i cannot get the directory to reload without shutting down the app entirely : 

input: fix your subtitle delay settings it so hard to adjust if it is delayed so much and everytime i changed the subtitle delay it creates new subtitle which and i cant sync it i almost spend two hours for syncing subtitle using this switching to mx player i dont have to sync the first time i played it : 

input: great except my videos in vp8vp9 webm dont display correctly and two wide blocks blur the screen used to work fine before and after update reinstalling did not help edit it was because of low battery its all fine above 10 : 

input: i love how it reads all type of videos but it disappoint me that the refresh button is not working it cant read new videos i added either when i deleted it i have to delete app data and wait more than 15 minutes for the app to parse all videos in my phone please fix this : 

input: your new update sucks please fix it i can not find my music by typing anymore i have to manually search it the player doesnt search for audio files ad strongly as it used ti do i had to find the music file on my phone and play it only then would the player show that music file : 

input: lame wont continuous play from beginning of the track and always have to keep re tapping the play single track everytime i open the app very hard to find tracks and sound clips uploaded why cant all music sound bites and clips just be in 1 place not in 700 different folders i have no clue : 

input: doesnt turn off ever after youve selected a song it runs in the background even if you kill the app not certain if it does the same with video dont much care if it doesnt get lost when i tell it to get lost then it can get the hell lost right off my phone : 

input: i have been using this app for a year now and its great my only problem is it doesnt like to refresh with new files it says its parsing but never finds anything thankfully its super easy to uninstall and reinstall i recommend it : 

input: latest version update has deleted one of my playlists removed all the tracks from another and made the playlist interface wasteful and cumbersome often crashes when unpausing from notification tray for example i didnt think it was possible for them to make this app worse but they did : 

input: totally trash after last update if it opens it locks up on the directories screen saying loading after that i cant even get back to the android launcher half of the time it totally hoses the phone really disappointing because it used to be a great app : 

input: the latest update is good but please fix on the subtitle part i cant download subtitle i dont know why : 

input: why vlc media set colour bit 16 bit instead of 32 bit and 64 bit for more colour depthness :

input: after new update aap is not working properlywhen i open the app its show me the blank screen : 

input: too fast and relaiable         : 

input: i can just about forgive the lack of a grid list but the fact that this app doesnt recognize file names and makes them up is beyond the pale vlc always works well on computers but the app looks like it was thrown together in a hurry uninstalled : 

input: im using this app from past 5 years it gave a great experience but its for the first time this update is not that great we cant even play or listen our newly downloaded files and we try to rename it does not appears on the screen and takes a lot of to scan files plus we need to reinstall it so it annoys a lot pls fix this bug in your cumin update : 

input: even on new phone every 24 h you need restart phone because this app when play video video play only sound and picture goes black screen so after phone restart any video play correctly but after 1 day every video play in black screen can someone repair this bug : 

input: as much as i am a fan of the pc version i think this android one is a mile behind just because one cannot multi select videos in an attempt to delete them you have to do it one by one like cranking up a manual car window its tiring bro : 

input: the app is very good actually the problem is the stuttering when playing certain formats it can be so annoying that you need find another player in order to watch smoothly : 

input: this app is great but theres something bothering me every time i play a ts file sometimes it doesnt play all i can see is black glitch when doing fast forward and sometimes when inserting subtitle file it shows errors : 

input: still have to add subtitles even after i added it before and sometimes when i exit the app just for a moment the subs disappear and i have to readd it again which is quite fussy and can i have the files not added into folder despite having same name title its quite confusing when i cant find my latest video : 

input: love the app but recent updates have changed so much that now a video does not resume from the same position it left off annoying to be starting video over and over and having to find the spot i left off at : 

input: wont cast properly display turns off after 3 seconds very annoying press play and it wont play press pause and it wont pause then loses video all together i use vlc on pc and linux and its fantastic : 

input: can you please add a play next feature to this app so that the next song you choose to play will play instead of a random song what is up with a number always on the app image like if you got a message or a notification can you please fix this issue : 

input: the app don show ma videos and audios all of them it shows some of them only and i got no external storage also it does not scan the whole media contents so i decided to unnistall it ive been using it for 3years now but i cant be with this issue fix it im goin to rate it 5stars morethank you : 

input: the app works great but there is one bug which is when i restart the app and replay the video it asks to play the video from the begning or resume it so when i click to play from the beginning it resumes the video and when i click to resume it play from the beginning developer kindly fix it : 

input: great app really really really good however i with wirh music it would show the album art like ios does with apple music big and square full album cover with artist and song full time bar with seeking too but even if the notifications dont look the best it works a dream : 

input: some high quality videos freeze at times and wont play smoothly and the scenes get grey overlap while the audio keeps playing plz fix this annoying issue : 

input: nice basic audio player one big feature is the ability to listen to a network audio stream if you have the url im still looking for some way to automate the creation of playlists so that i dont have add tracks oneatatime : 

input: doesnt properly do the one thing i wanted it to do which is to watch streamed videos if the video is paused and the device locks the app is unable to resume it the only solution is to type the url again : 

input: atrocious performance all around biggest complaint is that if you pause a video for more than a minute the sound is gone and will not return even after app and phone shut down : 

input: worked great a month ago now latest update plays choppy skipping freezing videos from my network pc on my phone when chrome casting vlc cant render 1080p changed numerous vlc settings but hasnt improved have 600 mb internet through 5ghz wifi my hardware is not the issue : 

input: hello would it be possible to give vlc the ability to add edit remove album art to any format audio file that is being played im asking because this ability is present in the legacy app windows media player for windows pcs which ive done it on many times before and i was wondering how nice it would be if vlc could do it thanks : 

input: i use the desktop application for movies so thought about using this as a music player for my android probably more features than i need and i am unwilling to learn how to use going to look for a more basic program that maybe just plays my audio files and doesnt do a whole lot else : 

input: does a lot of awesome things that most media players dont do the only thing is that theres this bug that doesnt save your progress on a videosong so it restarts when you go back into it after closing the app would be nice to see this fixed in an update : 

input: how about a recently added section how about when tap on ab repeat a slider bar dropsopens to set startend instead of using the songs playing slider as the ab repeat screen closes having to open it again to complete the process : 

input: if you group videos you cant tile them you can only see them in a list now change it back : 

input: i would really love to give it a 5 star rating but the only problem is that the picture in picture mode has a little hitch very short but nuisant delay so check on that otherwise good job on the app : 

input: only downloaded this to review it i downloaded it on my amazon fire tv stick and it was the worst move ever constantly buffering i have amazingly fast broadband too it plays about 2 minutes then buffers then plays about 2 minutes then buffers i cant believe how sick i am of little orange rotation traffic cones : 

input: this app is too good but this new update has made my volume 200 and every time i try to reach 100 my system sends a notification that says you cannot reach above 100 i m sleepy so sorry for the chinglish :

input: lacking settings effecting daily use : 

input: 323 upgrade i lost all my playlists for my music on the sd card this is not good : 

input: before updating i can download subtitle of a movie but now its not working why : 

input: video lags but xplayer plays the videos perfectlythats why i uninstall vlc fix it : 

input: there is a bug that makes the video keep repeating only the last part of the videos : 

input: the app keeps on crashing once minimised the file needs to be opened from the location itself as the app crashes and not often but every time the app needs regular updates which are very rare : 

input: great app but there is one little annoying bug if i have subtitles downloaded for a file already even then i have to download them again from the app itself it doesnt show the subtitle i have already downloaded : 

input: so ive deleted a few songs which were in the library but when i refresh the song names still appear even tho i cant play them ive to uninstall reinstall the app everytime i delete a song or download a new one : 

input: the new update sucks ive never had so many problems with vlc now considering replacing with a new app just as im bout to play a song everytime without fail it crashes not happy want to downgrade to previous version not happy : 

input: the latest update has a strange bug that causes the player to be stuck in casting mode so videos cant be played its always worked before then so this is clearly a bug that needs fixing : 

input: the idea is great but their seek tracker does not work however many seconds you fast forward or reverse it defaults to the nearest minute which is very frustrating : 

input: most recent update has left the app not detecting music in the directory folders no music was lost physically but cant play it through the quick selection screen now i have to go through all the directory folders manually to find an album or song : 

input: before the recent update vlc would have had 5 stars however the update broke the sleep timer also it seems to no longer support m3u playlist files even though they still show up as valid playlists : 

input: when i pause my audio the notification of vlc dismisses and i do not have have idea from which playlist file and at how many seconds i was listing this is very annoying it should be configurable kindly fix this annoying feature i dont care about adds but this issue waste my time to find the audio track : 

input: the last update has really messed things up songs in my library dont show up refreshing the app doesnt help restarting the phone and app doesnt help either ive deleted and reinstalled the app twice and the problem still persists : 

input: its good but lately its been having memory problems for me i leave in the middle of watching something and do something else on my phone and it sometimes restarts what ever im watching very frustrating : 

input: the latest update has nice changes but a bug has appeared where when i minimize or go away from vlc and then come back only a black screen shows i cannot resume my movie unless i click back and go back to the movie again please fix : 

input: i like this on my acer tablet as it recognizes certain formats of music and video which other apps do not however it doesnt work on my galaxy s7 edge connected to android auto in 2018 honda accord doesnt even show as an option : 

input: i like it but there is a problem with casting the video if im playing a video that has downloaded subtitles it plays fine on my phone but if i then cast it to my tv the subtitles wont show please can you look into this : 

input: i love this app but im getting a glitch on where the the prompt to ask to resume in my video list is not working anymore it only works if you are playing from the history folder the thumbnails are now blurry when selecting folders to scan reinstalling it doesnt work : 

input: very good image quality but some mp4 videos plays with interrupted sound every 56 seconds : 

input: it still will not update its filelist unless you uninstall and reinstall the app have they just left this bug in to get a fake download filecount to make it look as though more people are using it instead of just redownloading it every time it becomes unresponsive : 

input: please let us enabledisable the playback its so annoying when the video start from the playback and when i want to loop the loop is looping the video from the playback to end not from the beginning of the video even ive choosen play from start on the playback prompt pop up : 

input: always vlc is topnotch on either refresh or restart of the application new medias dont appear at an instant i think this is a bug on android version 9 pi eat it up vlc is still the best : 

input: random mode tends to repeat the same songs sometimes in the same sequence even if a playlist has more than a thousand songs it feels like you are always listening to the same 1520 songs also there is a bug when adding songs to a playlist : 

input: i have vlc on all my devices windows 7 and 10 this is the first time i have used it on android as with windows the android version has the same features a great graphic equaliser etc and no adds easy to use dont know why i havent tried it on android before many thanks : 

input: this app scans medis automatically even when we set the prerences to do it manually i wanted to choose the folders because the app plays my voice messages eg whatsapp as audio track i tried to delete my whatsapp folder from the vlc and vlc simply deleted all my whatsapp media from my internal memory i cannot choose manually which media i want the app to play horrible experience : 

input: please add more subtitle castomization pleasewe all just told to do that sirlike mx player otherwise the vlc player is the best player in the world but i am using mx player besause of that and please add the features to parmanently add subtitle in videos like windows vlc player please add the featuresmust must i know you can do itmr vlc if you do that i guaranteethe is the best player i guarantee i promote vlc in my wabsite : 

input: subtitles are not found easily otherwise great videoaudio player and after new update i miss old icon for buttons which can be seen on photos abovebelow : 

input: it used to be perfect but now i cant locate the delete option like before i always have to use file explorer to delete videos : 

input: streaming function is not working i entered video url many times but it didnt play : 

input: running great before this recent update abruptly stops especially when downloading subtitiles whats going on vlc : 

input: casting video file to tv works really well but subtitles doesnt work kindly fix it : 

input: i keep trying to add more music to the audio option but it wont : 

input: the app does not recognize m4a files anymore deletes songs from playlists or deletes playlists altogether i do not recommend this app unless you enjoy creating and recreating playlists edit the old version listed songs by artist when i went into genre now it only lists them in alphabetical order by song title what person thought this needed changed this app is unusable now does not play m4a files : 

input: its good but damn how can a longlivedcontinuous updating app doesnt have a seek time config forcing a 10 sec seek is just bad the desktop version have option to config it but android none damn 2 stars off till get that option up : 

input: the chromecast option is still unstable and subtitles are not working perfectly please fix this issue : 

input: worst app its latest version lags the video just stops but the sound continues to play : 

input: trash nothing like what it used to b like a group of useless idiots took over and intentionally made it unintuitive cant even easily fix the video playback in landscape or portrait basic feature for usage on a small devicesmartphone actually just to note i am 100 sure the dev team was hijacked for these latest versions jus so u know for anyone reading this : 

input: was great but every so often refresh stops working and wont find your files or remove old ones seems to be no other way but to uninstall and reinstall meaning you have to change all your settings all over again frustrating : 

input: i stopped using vlc last year but decided to install it again last week and to only find out that it still crashes cant refresh and find new music automatically deletes playlists its very annoying to re add music on playlist especially if you have many songs : 

input: very good though sometimes it doesnt load all the videos of my phone dont know why but because of this problem i have to uninstall it and then install it again : 

input: doesnt play surround sound through chromecast whats the point of playing a multichannel audio track on a one or two channel phone but not when casting to a 72 channel av receiver : 

input: it is nice but if we download the song one after one or like 4 to 5 song in a few hours then it not use to show even after restarting your phone or refreshing it many times and at last u need to uninstall the app and install it again : 

input: good choice of controls but the b st d started casting to local devices without me being able to stop it or reset it i have no idea how that switched on no video picture seen when it goes in this mode sound is on : 

input: the app loses your place about half the time and it refuses to play without the screen on meaning you cant put your phone in your pocket while listening to audiobooks for example its a terrible app : 

input: syncing the subtitle to 1000ms is easy but 10000ms takes a lot more time so when a new subtitle for the same video is opened resetting the subtitle delay back to normal can be done only by pressing the plus or minus sign till it reaches to 0ms it takes a lot more time : 

input: after installing the latest version my android shows android is starting optimizing app 1 of 1 i uninstalled the new version then reinstalled old version dec 2018 restarted my phone and the problem did not return please clear any bugs from the latest version : 

input: if you pause a song and want to continue the next day it never works you even have to navigate back again to the file wish it had sid support like win version uninstalled enjoying another free player that actually works : 

input: this app is god its completely intuitive and will play near anything like seriously i have never found a file that it cant manifest dont listen to the noobs that cant read instructions and trouble shootings correctlyill update after a week or so of searching for these bugs people speak of  : 

input: two major flaws 1 video and images are auto rotating even when device is in portrait mode everytime ive to lock ita bit of headache 2 pause and resume a video im experiencing a loss of sound for couple of seconds : 

input: i loved using this app until the previous its just been bugging me ever since the last update the sleep timer for music no longer works and it was one of my favourite features please fix this so i can change this back to a five : 

input: i absolutely love this app i use it everyday when im drawing or reading the one problem is whenever i download any songs it usually doesnt show up in vlc unless i reinstall the app : 

input: this app can play can play almost every type videos and it has met every expectations of mine but there is only one problem that we cant download a variety of subtitles for movies and series that your competitor mx player offers so please see through this problem : 

input: this used to be my favorite video app but since the last update the shuffle doesnt work right now it just shuffles between a few videos instead of my whole video list very aggravating : 

input: not updating to latest version because many users are reporting that new version has some bugs and the new ui is not user friendly than the previous old one : 

input: since the last update it wont keep my audio list still plays the songs on my sd card but i cant view the list going to have to start looking for a different audio app : 

input: the pc version was the absolute best but as usual android totally ruined it and the android version doesnt work at all it wont search or navigate or find music it wont skip to the next song etc : 

input: issues casting with chromecast ultra volume is low when casting cannot adjust volume whilst casting to device despite volume bar changing on android device sound off or on 0 100 volume remains unchangable video source mp4 via network using smb : 

input: needs urgent fix for android 9 users pip has lot of bugs when i switch to another app or to the homescreen and try to switch back to the app it crashes kindly fix when i enter pip and then go back to full screen i see a blank screen with only the audio playing : 

input: is ok but some video always store with diffrent name like just play the video or just press play imagin downling a video of 5 episodes only to watch 1and 2 and you cant fine the rest bcos it has been store with diffrent name on its own and its very slow some videos dont also play at all making me have a lot of video app on my phone pls fix it  : 

input: 1 small flaw when th video is short just second and i played it it play and stop and exit instantly then it so hard to click the pause and add loop to it when it exit you will click the file again and again the problem is when it stop the video it exit in an instant scenario i was veiwi g 360 preview just seconds and i want to analzye the turn it play in second and just exit i could not in hurry tap the pause button its anoying hehe : 

input: this vlc device isnt working on my phone i think its a junk couldnt play my musics videos no matter how many times i pushed to play but it will not play i pushed the play 5 times to play but no play all i can see it just gave me 26 junk on my phone and i have to clean out than uninstall : 

input: this app sucks trying to scroll through to other videos it keeps ruberbanding back to the beginning im using the samsung galaxy note 9 ive tried for a couple months and its always the same result i would highly avoid this app but try it to see if it works it just doesnt work for me trash : 

input: great player no issues at all with playback only issue i have had is on my tablet even though i have selected the folder with my videos in vlc says that the folders are empty if i browse to the folder with file manager i can choose to play them with vlc and they play perfect only a minor issue : 

input: why does this app seem to time out so quickly when playback is paused whats the point of adding a folder to favourites if theres nowhere to view favorites why wont this app remember where it was in a playlist and allow for resuming from there : 

input: it works but all my claims are about the app interface i dont the like both the app menu and the control elements during video playing with regards to last one its very annoying when some info appears on the screen center instead of bottom or corner i wish it was better : 

input: just one issue doesnt play next track unless a playlist is made : 

input: maybe some of you guys dont have the same problem vlc now makes both my plugged headset and speaker work at the same time : 

input: worst update ever why remove the option to sort by date you just made the files more clustered : 

input: overall good app but subtitles are not downloading on any videos have to download off other sites and import into vlc : 

input: awesome experience so far ive had no problems with vlc : 

input: it somtimes freezes the video but the audio is still playing : 

input: downloaded because ossadvertised as editor doesnt edit a lotcutjoin only equaliseno idea need compactest editor love foss modern angelic superheroes not a small thing i owe my loyalty this does play but lacks a bit wish it was all 3 : 

input: i dont know what youve done but my vlc refuses to load my lan hdds im using a galaxy s9 whenever i go onto the network browser it just sits there saying loading before this i would reccomend this app to everybody but now its useless in my opinion : 

input: great app and works really well it all formats however one major flaw i see is that it doesnt have a stop button i have to press the back button each time to exit a video which seems kind of silly maybe you could look at implementing that : 

input: definitely a best video player but if we able to drag and change the position of subtitles could be better while so many people like me prefer fit screen option when we go for fitscreen half of the subtitle is getting hidden pls fix this soon : 

input: please fix the automatic sensor in which if you turn your phone upside down it will also rotate 180 degrees please limit it to 90 degrees only also there is a bug in which the deleted movies still shows up in the menu : 

input: only complain i have is after a recent update t refresh feature does not actively check for new videos being added to my phone anymore it used to be very auto but now i have to press refresh a few times to get my new videos to show up : 

input: best multimedia app but they should add lyrics option on the music player and when we close the app the now playing playlist closes we have to reopen and reselect the song to play while its ui can be improved but over all its awesome : 

input: it is nice for playing videos coz i upgraded to this version as it supports almost all formats of videos but it does not play audio files at once and sometimes never playsi did not find any solution for it : 

input: i was very good for watching all videos grouping is great ihave been using this for quite a while now but donno whats wrong with it now after the update it closes suddenly and frequently and its irritating : 

input: nice interference has good quality of video playing but low stars because it has some bugs manytimes while am playing the video on landscape mode the video is not playing only the audio and subtitles were running out please fix the bug soon : 

input: crashed five out of five times moments into starting a song since the last update i also turned off the automatic library check and it does it upon opening regardless please get to fixing : 

input: theres no way to change artist and album info so all of the songs are lumped together under one artist i also moved a bunch of song files from one phone folder to another now i have duplicate songs that wont play and wont allow me to delete these 2 issues make this app unusable : 

input: you cant choose the way your files are listed beyond alpharev alpha thats really annoying theres other ui nitpicks i have as well not sure why this is an editors choice the pc version is really goodstep it up dudessmart phones are way more relevant now : 

input: mostly good but ff rw and jump functions dont work when streaming ts video oddly those functions work fine if the ts file is copied to the device via wifi or usb can this be addressed in a future update : 

input: it was an amazing user experience for me but you could make it better by adding lyrics for musics and also add subtitle website when downloading as i cant find them also when i play a song it stops i have to keep clicking and clicking continously before it starts : 

input: good media player cant play tvheadend streams by just typing in the ip and port which is a little disappointing all it will say is 19216801199981 is not streamable or some other generic read error but good for other use : 

input: the update mentions multitasking shutdown fixed they did a terrible job whenever i open any media file from file manager using vlc and switch tasks it abruptly shuts down on top of all they plainly lie about the update useless team really disappointed phone redmi note 5 pro : 

input: needs a toggle to switch from resume playback to start from beginning it resumes even when history is off and confirm resume is the only way to start from beginning which i find annoying i dont want vlc to remember where i left after i exit the app : 

input: best free player around but the new release have a problem that when playing video if user turn off screen that pause the video when on again the video use to continue playing but now it just hangs there need to restart app to continue : 

input: last update was good after the recent update i am not able to open the app from recent used app if i minimise the application and then try to open it again it shows black screen please fix the problem it is happening every time since the recent update : 

input: theres something wrong with the back button process when entering a folder that contains videos and then trying to back to the main videos page theres a glitch  : 

input: just a bug i have been experiencing recently vlc is not detecting new media files say i downloaded a new song but it does not show up automatically in the audio section so it is a little bumming : 

input: after the update i could no longer play seamlessly my hd videos on from a nas connected via networkwifi on my samsung s10 even videos which played seamlessly before the update all video files wont play as it keeps buffering every few seconds hope this will be address asap : 

input: love the app best ive tried runs very smoothly the only problem i have is that whenever i go to swipe up the touchscreen buttons on my samsung s8 i delete things off my playlist utterly confusing when im listening to audiobooks : 

input: ive downloaded almost every media player and had nothing but disappointment until i downloaded this one i can say after 1 month of using it ive had not one issue of any kind great player : 

input: app is very good but the latest version is working well in my device moto z play 80 the issue is when i want to rotate my device to landscape mode while playing video it converted into pip mode im not able to see video in full screen mode please resolve the issue : 

input: last version is fine but this latest version removed one feature that is forwarding and backwarding video can be done by just sliding on the screen now we cant do in this latest version that is very dispointing very inconvenient forwarding video on the bar is very inconvenient : 

input: doesnt support smb 23 which means it cant access my file share smb 1 is riddled with security flaws so im not turning it back on not much use for this app until it supports secure protocols : 

input: the application automatically plays the video that is next in the queue while the current video is still playing and therefore the current video never gets to the end i hope they fix this : 

input: second to none for videos but if you add an album with various artists it will not keep them together in the album tab also seems to have problems reading some video formats on an sd card : 

input: ive had few problems so far but now upon clicking tracks it wont play the ones selected but others which are far up or down the list tried uninstalling and refreshing it wont work properly : 

input: it used to great now it is rubbish wont refresh a lot of unnecessary features and now i have found out it asks to record audio spyware uninstalling : 

input: vlc video player is goodplz remove audio player from itit suckfor example if you so many songs in your phone vlc media liberay take rescan a lot of timeso i have to wait vlc to finish rescan to watch a videosso plz remove audio player from it and make two sperate apps that allthank you : 

input: it stops playing music when i turn off the screen then i gotta press the play button on my bluetooth headphones and it will play for a bit longer just to stop again : 

input: what happened this app was brilliant nice simple and easy to use now its clunky loses my place and wont parse new media without being reinstalled trying to use this for work purposes and you have spoiled that for 22 children with useless updates that have ruined the app : 

input: only issue i have with this is app is the disappearing playlistsits not a big issue but its annoying that i have to keep recreating my playlistsit is unmatched when it comes to playing music and videosplaylist need work though : 

input: app is pretty amazing but i hate the fact that if i want to turn the brightness up in between a video the app increases the entire device brightness instead of the app only which means after leaving the app i need to again go yo display settings and adjust the device brightness : 

input: overall the its great but one thing thats very annoying and ruining the usability of the app that if pip is on from the app settings the video will go to pip mode when turned into landscape mode and it wont go full screen on landscape mode it will just go in pip mode please fix this issue : 

input: tried again newly updated version but still media library doesnt load properly sort by file name not working and worst part is it is showing weird files like idxm3u8 i love this player but file arrangement is very very bad switching back to mx player : 

input: how to use overlay appears every time you openthe app on a tv is annoying because you have to pause and play again probably on a touch device goes away by touching am empty area still its damn annoying every time : 

input: it doesnt play every media file type i cant play drm protected music files unless i am doing it wrong that i put on my android phone from itunes the computer version is still better : 

input: vlc for android has gone downhill still love it for pc lately on my phone the app suddenly quits it also does not resume where it left off now i use podcast addict which does everything and then some : 

input: everything works fine but annoying bug for bluetooth device during im playing videos in playlist with bluetooth headphones aptx connected the vlc will disconnect bluetooth headphones everytime after moving to next video i can play the same videos in google photos without this problem : 

input: after casting a few movies and having it lock up and having to restart the movie over and over again it was time to move on i downloaded mx player and it is much more stable and has many other excellent features that vlc just doesnt have : 

input: the only problem vlc has auto finding new media file just been downloaded on the storage sometimes it doesnt catch the new filefiles on the gallery even if refreshed manually that is the reason im giving it 4 on the other sides its the best media player on android market : 

input: all the crashes on android 10 have been resolved looks like app is stable again the android tv app is still glitchy when i scroll around in the menus but it is usable the beta constantly asked for login info when using smb shares but the regular version just has the gui glitches : 

input: really bad management of local audio files if pause and go back manually using the player bar its stuck and cant play the file going to the next track doesnt work either of manually press next button completely useless with audio avoid : 

input: slower than the previous version and the data storage had balooned to a ridiculous 600mb from a manageable 150mb i would downgrade if i could : 

input: i love this app but after i updated it the video list is dissappear even i refreshed it my video list still doesnt show up : 

input: worked really well for a while but when i wanted to listen to music right now it simply says no media content or something like that i tried reinstalling the app and uploading files several times it still says the same thing as it freezes up : 

input: the new update sucks the subtitles do not downloadband existing subtitles do not load from previous downloads as well please fix it : 

input: the app itself is great however the new interface is so irritating if its not broken dont fix it : 

input: real nice apps but in last update the pair with tv seems to have gone please put it back in : 

input: during casting through chromecast the video inbetween got disconnected automatically or not playing after 10 to 20 mins of mobile locked : 

input: why is it that sort by date feature is removed organization of files need to be improved : 

input: last update makes it randomly stop audiobooks every minute or two ugh : 

input: goodbut while incresing sound from 100 to 200 the sound clarity is very bad : 

input: really good video player it can play without videoscreen on can make playlists can play in background the only problem is that itll become silent for a few seconds in the beginning of a video when its in a playlist : 

input: the app is very good except one thing all the videos are cluttered in one long page the directories also show all file types which are not audio or video so its very hard to find a video : 

input: was the best app for my audio files started parsing media all the time a couple of months ago and today it completely lost all of my files sad now i have to find a new media player : 

input: tried to watch some episodes of my favourite tv show and i only got audio tried finding a solution online and got absolutely nowhere tried a different app and it worked straight away always thought vlc was the best and have been using it on pc for years disappointing : 

input: updated to 1 star because pitch still changes throighout track its good for the most part there is one bug where audio files pitch changes at the start of a track which actually gets pretty annoying please fix : 

input: using vlc since 2005 pc she devs should to look into though when changing video speed to 11 or 12x and casting to cc audio gets choppy may just be me or a cc limitation htc m8 droid60 vlc 3013 cc 2 wifi ac1200 1080p mkv x265 : 

input: the app functions great that is until i get a phone call and the screen will not return the video after it ended and i have to exit out and select the video only to have to find my place again : 

input: im using a pixel xl device and my buttons are on the screen and with the last update when i watch videos in landscape and pause it the button bar comes up and it squeezes the image into a compreesed one which did not happen in previous versions please fix this : 

input: great just great plays everything either local media files or files from a shared network folder supports subtitles playlists casting to chromecast exactly what i was looking for : 

input: the android versions not bad unfortunately one cant access metadata such as comments and tags unlike vlc for winos this version doesnt support replaygain thats a pity : 

input: the cast feature causes the mobile to reboot if are using the cast feature of the vlc app and you try to close the cat opeartion it forces the mobile reboot automatically it is a showstopper defect kindly fix this defect on priority : 

input: what happend these 23 day i always need restart my phone in order to use vlc i have blank screen with vlc logo it wont show any video audio only please fix it i really like vlc idont have any problem in my laptop : 

input: its great because it actually plays nonmp3 files which countless players on here dont do however its been continuously parsing looking for files on the device so much that my favorites list keeps disappearing : 

input: loved it no ads all i need just please add following 1 control music and video without unlocking display or maybe voice commands for next previous and so on 2 displaying video and music in folders only media folders : 

input: after receiving call its not working i tried twice to open but vlc isnt running i have another way open vlc then select media but every time doing this is pathetic video dont start from where i left watching every time its starting from beginning : 

input: ive use the desktop version for years to avoid the spying that wmp subjects us to love it however the mobile version often cant be stopped requiring one to power cycle their htc m9 device to make it stfu not good : 

input: this used to work fine and i have used vlc on my pc for years for some reason on android this cannot play anything without skipping and making weird noises to the point where you cant listen to anything : 

input: im not sure what happened but since the last update i think the app thinks its on a tablet and not a phone the menus and lists of videos run off the screen i cant even see the buttons to press it is now simply impossible to use : 

input: while playing in audio mode and lock the home screeen of phone audio gets stop automatically and if user wants to continue listening heshe must keep phone unlocked i hope this will be fixed soon thanks : 

input: great video player but still havent solved the issue of not being able to delete files on sdcard still has to use another app for that and vlc tends to not recognizing file changes which always results a full data clean and resetting prefferences : 

input: nowhere near the pc version freezes sometimes and i have to reboot the phone pulling battery out because it freezes everything so buttons dont respond screen looks as if someone cracked it up : 

input: really dislike this app it often reparses my music files which takes a long time frequently misreads files so i will get multiple instances of the same album i dont understand why it gets editors choice someones getting bribed somehow : 

input: i love this app for watching movies web series and listening to songs mp3 favourite part is i can download subtitles for everything in the app itself one thing i didnt like is i dont have a automatic mp3 player everytime i have to choose for songs pls update the mp3 player : 

input: good app but needs improvement subtitle does not work using google chromecast also when disconnect the app from casting to tv video does not work though we can hear audio we have to resstart the app after disconnection from casting : 

input: it works great but why does it not retain your position in a song when you pause it after a few seconds it backs out completely this is highly frustrating : 

input: been using vlc for years on my pc recently added to android auto then you took that away due to google getting their panties in a wad no problem install an older version and never update it been going strong in my truck for a year now : 

input: this used to be a great app now i pretty much cant get through playing one file without it stopping and crashing on me completely unusable at this point : 

input: htc 10 not happy since last google update vlc is playing up it is saying it has no media files on start up and sits loading for a minute or 2 every time also takes upto a minute to loadstart a video each time too very annoying please fix thanks : 

input: there have been problems in regards to playlists managing one will crash the app and pressing delete doesnt delete it at all even with refreshing or rebooting the phone other than that it is a great media player : 

input: vlc has a fantastic reputation and i enjoy using it however can you please fix the casting problems i never get consistent playback when casting to my tv its very frustrating : 

input: since the app updated for me last night the brightness and volume gesture actions do not work the seek gestures do not work and im suddenly pretty unhappy with an app ive been very happy with for several years now time to look for something new i guess : 

input: i have been using this app for the last 5 years but in the last few months it has been annoying too much all my deleted videos list in the panel of vlc they doesnt delete from the app either : 

input: after deleting the video it appears on the list and cant able to remove from app due to the reason im not getting whether the video available in mobile or not the deleted videos also showing thumbnails in the list only for that im giving 4star otherwise i love vlc : 

input: great but has annoying bug when i pause vid shut screen when i go back to vlc window it closes so i have to relocate the video file and manually find the time i stopped other than that 5 stars : 

input: on every update the streaming addreses are deleted why on earth you do this also stream addresses cannot be imported i have to type them again and again annoying and on my lenovo device the app crashes on every screenoff : 

input: waste of time if you need to get anything done wont let me create playlists and just seems to crash any time i try to do anything uninstalled and reinstalled twice in the hope it might help but still nothing disappointing : 

input: this app is excellent for my latest android 90 tv set top box which i use with the stb emulator pro app it works extremely well and seamessly within the stb emu app once you go into the stb select media select vlc there are no ads no issues extremely clear smooth hd quality its compatible with most os and auto setup i did change or configure anything inthe vlc app : 

input: no autoplay cant add my own songs cant change song info to customize the beginning of each song starts to play for 1 second then stops and starts again almost like a skip other than that i love it haha : 

input: the app keeps on deleting musics which are not downloadedand everytime i refresh the appthe musics are still nowhere to be foundonly downloaded musics can be foundalso regarding the audio when playin a videoit has a little static in its audio but when i try using another media player with the same videoit doesnt have the same audio static which the vlc has : 

input: the way sorting works is strange you would think that a file structure like this d1 t1mp3 d2 t1mp3 d10 t1mp3 would be sorted as above actually it is sorted like this d1 t1 d10 t1 d2 t1 confusing and windows and linix file managers sort the first way had to right some code to substitute numbers with az and use za to 27 : 

input: update has taken away the play as audio option multiple selections are multiplied further down the list as well if i select the first two for instance and scroll down there are 4 or more videos that have been selected as well : 

input: this new update is a downgrade compared to the previous one its loads videos slower and you cant delete videos through the app again i regret updating the app : 

input: it loaded the video but automatically paused any external audio sources : 

input: still cant access my local network videos ever since the new uodate using vlc 323 local network is hosted via ubuntu server 1804 lts over samba : 

input: darkmode toolbar wont go dark  : 

input: selecting subtitles not working very well the rest of it is pretty good : 

input: seems ok for video however for mp3 its pretty poor tried to play some mp3 files from my sd card it shows the number of files stored in that directory click on it folder empty no it bleedin isnt : 

input: full of bugs after update no video plays before that on seeking 1080p vids video freezeswith each and every update the vlc gets ruined : 

input: was a great app until the latest update cannot play all my music and it stops mid song was a 5 now a 1 star app please fix : 

input: become worse after current update vlc forget my last played audio this problem occurs after last update : 

input: great player but chromecast support is sketchy frequently disconnects andor restarts the video i use chromecast quite a lot so i guess ill have to look elsewhere : 

input: great app i use it a lot the only problem is that when you go back to a video the resume function often fails and takes you to the beginning of the video  : 

input: the app was working fine before but from last few weeks its not working at all when i play a video than the screen is black with vlc logo in the middle and no video is played but audio is fine in the background i have mailed to vlc team but no reply from them  : 

input: ive been installing and uninstalling inorder to find an appropriate video player for my old generation phone and couldnt find any until i stumbled into this and this ended my search for what i need all this while i must say awesome this app is fantastic for what it does : 

input: how do you take an app that was one of the best around and turn it an utterly worthless piece of junk this was my only music app for literally years after the update it consistently cannot find my music or playlists one day i see all my music one day theres no music another day i may see some of my music i kept hoping there would be a fix but im not seeing it time to walk away from the train wreck uninstalling : 

input: i cant see my local mp3 songs in the playlist please fix this earlier all the music albums were present under audio section but now i have go to directories to play every song please help : 

input: hate the upgrade since the recent upgrade vlc wont find the music on my sd card it wont even give me an option to use the sd card as a directory i preferred the old version my playlists wont work either : 

input: chromecast streamming is buggy every time i cast a video using my s8 the video on my tv appears to not display properly some places on the screen get pixelated and stop moving but when i use localcast or plex the video quality is fine : 

input: i would only love for it to read flac files as different tracks like it does on windows oh and add favourite folders since it finds my downloaded music but not my downloaded podcasts and i have to look them up manually each time : 

input: terrible app has only icons which mean absolutely nothing since a few days it only show a gigantic orange logo no sound no picture just orange blob completely useless : 

input: smb support broken and they dont seem to be in a hurry to fix it no option to configure smb password app lies and says directoy is empty when its really just failing to connect to the smb share not my smb configuration because other apps connect fine : 

input: the only need for improvement is that when i download or receive new videos to my phone it doesnt always automatically start parsing the media when i open the app so i sometimes have to uninstall and reinstall for it to load the new videos : 

input: why does this app keep having to rescan my disc everytime it does that it takes 20 to 30 minutes to do so and my playlists get deleted all my music is wma so this is the app i need please fix this problem : 

input: intermittently stops playing my media fine when listening to music its generally easy enough to skip to next track but if im five minutes into an audio book when the app just drops the audio thats a real nuisance  : 

input: love this i upgraded my phone and the old videos of my kid wouldnt play on new phone this app lets them play i use this program on my pc too amazing product and simple to use : 

input: subtitles do not work while chromecast you should take this issue on priority basis and resolve this issue is also raised in many different forums online not able to cast subtitles is of great inconvenience : 

input: cant find my music or even the directory theres no way to communicate with the app if it wont find external storage or the files its just not happening sleep timer doesnt work either : 

input: casting is an issue ive reinstalled this app a few times and still the casting button refuses to appear i even tried to look in the settings options but it was no help other then that it works as expected : 

input: its a great player but i have to reinstall ever time i add a new song ive seen that in the git repo that this problem has been going on for some time now and is still not fixed vlc doesnt add a new song to the library when its detected : 

input: two things i dont like about this app are 1 when u slightly rotate the phone the video switches from landscape to portrait mode 2 cannot enter the video name while searching for subtitles also no option to adjust subtitle size its a great app though : 

input: i have lots of music some i dont remember my problem is the shuffle its repeats the same previous track when i skip to previous track can you make it shuffle botb previous and next button thank you : 

input: im a huge fan of vlc but this app is pretty unstable the ui isnt that good either at least as a audio player what a shame i switched to foobar2000 also a good windows audio player : 

input: it used to be great now i spend 99 of the time trying to find media again and again what happened why do i have to rescan almost every time i open the app no longer worth having on my phone : 

input: i dont want to write a bad review since i enjoy using this app alot but i have been experiencing an error upon using it when i play my videos all it does is shows a black screen with the vlc logo on it kindly fix it soon thank you : 

input: vlc is getting on my nervesit keeps showing no media files foundi think it crashed just like that and would not show up any media files anymoreits very annoyingdespite uninstalling and installing it still would not work : 

input: so many features are missing i want to move on from mx player but vlc doesnt have a good subtitle downloader no fast forward shortcut and video size cannot be dynamically controlled was almost perfect : 

input: i prefer the old version it is easy to navigate downloading subs unlike this new version its really annoying specially when your watching a movie the voice and the subtittle does not match please make an update to resolve this issue : 

input: its not working properly whenever i used to increase playback speed its buffers while i watch video from youtube there is no problem in internet connection its something application problems its irritating please fix it : 

input: the best app for listening to audiobooks so far scans for and orders chapters better then the number of others upd app stores progress on the track when closed however doesnt show which track was active which blackplayer does : 

input: buggiest video and audio player i have ever seen it misses to play some seconds of audio while doing actions like pauseplay increasedecrease playback speed going full screen etc what is the point of watching a video then  : 

input: what really bugs me when using this is when sometimes i click on a music track to play and it just refuses to play it either it cuts off after 2 seconds or it just doesnt play at all would love to see a fix to this : 

input: the latest update is atrocious i could initially easily select to play all songseither as video or audio plus could play in portrait mode now the app in itself starts in landscape mode and then going through the directories and alphabetical listings is very very annoying : 

input: all of a sudden playlist view its stuck on thumbnails no option to have list view which is just plain stupid coz it only shows 1st 3 letters of title on the thumbnail which is completely useless : 

input: no ads supports most all formats cant beat that : 

input: great app love all the features that i can use to watch videos there is however a clicking noise that appears only in vlc but doesnt appear on the default media player on my phone can somebody help : 

input: its fine but recently i cant download subtitle file : 

input: vlc is thief i just opened vlc data folder that was inside folder android there i found around 700 thumbnails from the video that were saved in my phone and worse is that there were thumbnails from those videos also that i didnt even play using vlc this means vlc is accessing all our videos and saving their thumbnail that too 3 or 4 without our knowledge : 

input: still the best open source media player around in my opinion comes prepacked with the most common video codecs been using it for years and never found the need to look for an alternative : 

input: not good 1takes so much time to scan media 2cant browse video by folder 3no indicator of new videos 4cant sort by time in directories 5cant zoom in or zoom out 6no customization : 

input: new giu looks great guys good job ive been using vlc on android tabletsphonestvs for years android tv had a rocky start and for the last few months ive experienced quite a few problems untill this update yo i have a networked storage device in my house i use for content and the android tv and cast support has been spotty till the update the new gui looks sexy i havent had any videos freeze or buffer repeating one file hasnt crashed keep up android tv progress d thanks guys : 

input: try to open a video and then switching between apps and vlc will state cannot open vlc and you will have to locate and start the video from the beginning not funny cause its been almost a year and still happens : 

input: its a good app installed it cause my phones video player doesnt support some audio in my mp4 videos : 

input: we asking for more bass please remove that 31 and replace it with 15 please  : 

input: there is no option for cast to tv screen mirroring : 

input: oh its so fantastic members you are missing out on this app : 

input: good app but the reason for 3 is that cant play high hd quality video and cant download subtitles : 

input: this app hangs after some day of installation i need to uninstall it and reinstall again loading problem happend every time may be this app made like this way for more and more downloads collection : 

input: ive been using the app for a couple of years now but since the new update it keeps crashing everytime i rotate the video and returns me to the directory : 

input: its really useful but its really annoying and takes a lot of time and effort to recognize a record while i already have it in the music section would you try to fix it  : 

input: what a horrible experience not a single video plays correctly no matter at which settings on most i simply get a black screen and choppy audio others show a few keyframes really no idea why this thing is hyped : 

input: anytime vlc play back a video got interrupted it did not resume and allow playing back that video anymore i found out the only way to allow it to play that video again is to reinstall vlc appreciate if you can fix this bug thanks : 

input: i love it i had been using an old dell for music got tired of all the power sucking and just over it put this on a 9in tablet this is fantastic and better music quality great app : 

input: this player has no ads it will be more great in playing videos and audio files like mp3 etc with properly configure its an open source i iike using it in playing video streaming like youtube etc : 

input: it take more time to load items than other popular players when i open for next time same initial loading shows it is irritating you should give skin to vlc like pc pip mode is awesome please fix the loading or refreshing bugmake it fast to load : 

input: i still prefer ver3013 because i play many video with video speed like17times the newer cannot retain the speed after watching another video i have many video to watch so i need more speed faster to finish watching : 

input: most players fail to play few videos most especially because the format is unsupported whilst vlc got my back to be honest its a sleeping memory in my mind that pops the name of this app : 

input: will give it a 5 star when these issues get fixed 1 after downloading a movievideo they dont appear automatically when i open vlc i have to refresh it manually 2 refreshing for new files takes way longer compared to other video players : 

input: love vlc but i wish it would save my spot on my media when i pause it and minimize in a librivox audio zipfile playlist when i come back i have to start over and seek to the track i was at : 

input: use to be great i only use vlc to stream to my chromecast but half the time the chromecast button doesnt show up on vlc and i have to restart my phone a few times for it to show up not worth it : 

input: has a few glitches like not showing all of my songs that i have on my device even with the folders selected but overall much better than any default player and with much more features : 

input: the best video audio player for android no ads no buffering and ac3 audio support and also plays prores files now plays with the notch unlike mx player no need to switch codecs at all and no ads : 

input: i guess developers are not paying attention anymore to the app because with each update it is getting worse and worse folders are not getting refreshed automatically and even if a file is deleted its thumbnail still remains : 

input: i love this app and is one of the best video players on a y pho e but since the last update everytime i rotate the screen the video restarts and shifts to pip for so e reason it used to work fine but this started after the update pls belp : 

input: thanks for making the sorting preferences permanent i have a new suggestion make that we could batch delete videos because we currently cant when selecting multiple videos there arent such options thanks in advance : 

input: not working right after update screen went blank after paused for several minutes i have to close the app and started it again also i have to find the video again where i left to paused : 

input: this app got one serious bug if we turn off screen while playing or pause the video the apps crash and cannot on anymore i need to restart the phone then only can use the apps again my phone is using android 8 : 

input: this app is great i use it on my chromebook the only problem happens when i watch higher quality mkv videos the picture has trouble loading on normal playback speed the last update has helped this but not fixed it : 

input: its an amazing app with great video player features and my personal favorite video player on android but should really expand on the sort settings eg add in date instead of just sorting things by name best place to watch videos though : 

input: the app works but after a while it will stop finding new videos ive tried all the options to refresh and all that the only way to fix the problem is to uninstall and reinstall and it finds everything again ok : 

input: used it for a long time when i had my laptop now that i have my phone i can say that this app is quit buggy and needs to be uninstalled and put backbin order to work well try looking up mxplayer same concept but doesnt bug : 

input: no option to view my videos in folders makes this player unusable for me why would anyone want to have all of their videos in one long long list instead of having them nicely grouped thats beyond me mx player wins all the way : 

input: i have a motorola moto z2 force the app has seek problems and whenever i rotate the screen the video restarts and lags please fix it and also when i switch between apps it freezes and just shows a black screen : 

input: vlc has been very oldi love it for high quality sound production but it sucks when u guys still maintain to have this very old obsolete gui please upgrade your interface to look sexy and classy or even gelly u guys dont deserve a star from me just added a star cos google play forced meupgrade to pretty interface like otherseven google play now is lovely : 

input: terrible subtitle glitch is present in this app whenever you leave this app the subtitles doesnt seem to work at all even after multiple attempts i request the developers to fix it asap : 

input: its the only music player that allows customizing the speed of songs since i love speeding them up and other players doesnt have that feature but please allow us to edit the playlists its hard to remove the songs from a playlist : 

input: everything is working fine but the picture in picture mode is no where in my new phone j4 core unlike my other phone which had the picture in picture mode in the manu please fix it or direct me to the picture in picture mode and ill change my rating : 

input: a very good app when you watch on your mobile but when i cast on my tv with google chromecast it works very badly very often it stops after 1520 min very hard to navigate and a big problem with the subtitle they arent cast : 

input: it can play everything but you cant minimize it when playing a video or it will crash and when you try to switch back to the app it says app isnt available well 5 stars arent available too : 

input: if you use sleep timer app keeps running in background there is no way you can close it neither you can play any other music it only stops when it crashes the very next time you open it another bug is there the double tap horizons scroll to seek doesnt work : 

input: its not easy at all to work with after closing the app every time that you go to folders to play songs you have to start from the beginning by pushing the play button cause there is not the now playing available on the whole i didnt like it at all : 

input: to your devs please enable only one toast message per playlist on playlists that are completely unavailable eg to stream you can reach up to minutes of screen blockage by url not available toast popups otherwise really great app : 

input: will not play 1080p mkv files it used to but will no longer do it pissed off because this used to be the only media player i needed everytime you update this app it becomes less user friendly and more broken please fix this or i will be uninstalling vlc : 

input: great video player dont like the new ui the new update with filename scrolling make it very hard to look for a specific file especially when having a lot of long file names i wish theres a way to disable the name scroll : 

input: you guys officially have the worst developers in the world you put up an update as if its going to solve all the previous problems and your update just adds more of them the best feature of this app was playing videos as audio and now i have to open the video and make it play as audio which is such a stupid ux also vlc was able to detect only 2 of my songs and the rest 700 arent even appearing same with the videos just hire better developers guys and bring the play as audio feature back : 

input: i cant group my videos and it annoys me to the intent of uninstalling this app hoping to get fixed asap : 

input: i dont like the new resizing feature that update needs to be deleted and replaced with the older interface : 

input: subtitle synchronisation option is too complex and needs an easy option to delay by entering numbers manually : 

input: when you click download subtitle it stopped : 

input: subtitle is not working at all downloading subtitle option is waste of keeping it after update except this all r good : 

input: after the latest update vlc wont save the last spot you watched a video after closing but saved an earlier spot which is the wrong one : 

input: the update was really disappointing my whole playlist is gone and also the whole media is not synced into vlc anymore too bad : 

input: wont download keeps saying waiting for wifi obviously if you are reading this post i do have wifi and the app is wrong : 

input: good but my subtitle download has problemso am downloading it again : 

input: hevc not working fine          :

input: the app is brilliant except that it shows the videos which are deleted and even after refreshing the videos dont go from list when we try to play them the app says file not found this should be resolved : 

input: for some reason i have to disable hardware acceleration in the newest version to have a smooth video playback previously there were no such issues :

input: vlc doesnt see the sd card in my tablet it wants me type in a path in 2019 clean music player sees my sd card automatically the videolan website is a nightmare to use on a tablet so no help there : 

input: the way the videos are split up into groups according to their names and not folder name sucks i wanted to switch to this because of the ads in mx player and the online streaming setup in it but cant coz vlc is just a complex collection of my videos :

input: been using vlc both on pc and tablet for a while now i will unistall after this updates increased privilege request why a video player would need access to my location and microphone will be moving on thanks : 

input: i loved this app until the recent update music stops playing every couple of minutes when im browsing the web the previous version did not do this : 

input: doesnt work well when you play videos in the background when you bring them to foreground there is no video just sound if you close app sound continues to play have to kill app to make it stop very frustrating : 

input: probably the best video player on android but subtitle downloading does not work when playing videos from network fileshares seems like a bug that should not be difficult to fix : 

input: the app is a great one but the resent did some set backs previously i could go a different app and come back to vlc and my video would be paused but now it starts over every time : 

input: useless since the update i can no longer see videos on my sd card in the gallery i tick it as an option but it just unticks when i refresh killed a good app its a known issue why is it not fixed yet : 

input: the new updates have left this app useless there are so many bugs and loss of functions that i was forced to delete the app and install the apk from 2018 seriously beta test your updates or better yet stop making changes : 

input: thought this would have a frame grab feature like the pc version does but this doesnt dragging the slider bar freezes the video and does not track frames like the built in photos on my pixel 2 promptly uninstalled : 

input: horrible unintuitive not user friendly seems like they dont want you to use it or they have zero idea what people want cant easily delete history old things get stuck and cant be forgotten like vlf for windows hate vlf for android : 

input: it works well as i have not experienced any glitches however when i watch anime i always have to change the audio as the default is the japanese audio they should add a feature were you chose the default audio and subtitle : 

input: i cant imagine its been a month since i uninstalled vlcit used to be great for years my daily app but now lags so much sometimes refuse to play any song until you restart itboring : 

input: this app has real potential its plenty of features such as pip support only gripe is the fact that on my device when tapping to reveal the controls the home menu and back buttons show on top preventing me from accessing the controls : 

input: used the best now its not bacause of auto rescan locks it up and i know i have the option to turn it off but when i do it locks up and wont close or crash out unless i uninstall it pitty i used to love this app : 

input: after the latest update i dont enjoy using the app anymore thedisplay over other apps features is bugged and it freezes the volume calibration is awful practically inaudible at 70 volume and the brightness gesture doesnt function occasionally fix it xo : 

input: awesome app only thing i dnt like is if music is being moved from internal storage to sd a blank copy of the songs stay behing meaning it looks like the song is on the playlist twice but it just wont play : 

input: please fix the audiomusic playlist system please return grouping videos by folder : 

input: till recent update it was working all good after updating the app all the files are gone it shows no media files and not even scanning internal storage of the phone star rating till recent updates 45 50 new rating 1 wish i could give zero : 

input: 1cant play with two different subtitles in the same time in a same movie 2 cant show videos folder rather it shows all video list whis is booring to search any video 3subtitle timing cant customize otherwise it is deserved for 5 star : 

input: the app is superb just like the desktop version it will play whatever codec you throw at it the two annoying things i found are 1 the video seeking experience isnt as smooth as in mx player 2 the subtitles stop working when you cast it to the tv : 

input: android 10 update pictureinpicture is buggy with a10 gestures when the popup player is enabled it doesnt seem to allow me to add more videos to the queue and swiping up using the new gestures causes the pictureinpicture window to go black at times : 

input: doesnt work any better than the default player which also cant display short webm files also doesnt have a loop video option to fix this why bother vlc is my go to video player on pc but here it is a waste of bits : 

input: pisss poor app doesnt play mkv through chromecast but it did the first time now it plays the audio only : 

input: fix it the player dont play all the videos after one video ends it stops i want it to be able to play all videos when being pressed : 

input: getting worse full of bugs videos wont show up : 

input: the new up date sucks doesnt recognize separate flac files loads the all at once also u have to find screen resizing an repeat modes updates arent always good should have left well enough alone : 

input: i wish i can spam 1 star but lucky for you i cant do it if choose play all and then i choose 1 song to play vlc just play one song and i cant click next weird but old version have that kind of feature and i really realli like it but new update mehhhhhhhhhh : 

input: the app is okay but when you download subtitle for a particular movie it will download another movie subtitle : 

input: nothing changes and also different mx player is best : 

input: guys where other video player stops working thats where vlc starts getting better love it with all my heart : 

input: after using the sleep timer function you need to reboot to use vlc again shuffle play doesnt really shuffle no option to skip forwardbackwards a few seconds only nextprevious i love vlc but not for android : 

input: the old video ratio was better play as audio feature is removed and many more features are removed : 

input: vlc is good in pc computer but in phone it is not good at all it takes time how to use the settings of it  : 

input: no one can beat this player it plays any video format when other players say wrong format  : 

input: subtitle download is not working cant download subtitles for movies even after displaying list of subtitles : 

input: its really a nice video playerbt sometime i face problem while downloading subtitle  : 

input: it sucks after update the ui is so terrible why the f did you put the play button in front of the 3 dots next to the song list also i already refresh but it didnt update the new song i have added instead i must search it all over to my directory fix the gui : 

input: could be better often doesnt have cast option when open app and have to restart phone pausing sometimes makes file start from the beginning again file can crash if you try to skip forward : 

input: p in p closes when you turn off screen clicking notification pull down opens app then you have to click a small tumb nail that then opens the video videos dont arrange in different folders video playback out of sync sound not matching persons mouth : 

input: i like the app but there is problem i face though i delete a video from the phone the clip still shows in the vlc directory thats very annoying : 

input: with the latest update the same track can appear multiple times in the playlist please correct this bug this never happened before in earlier versions : 

input: if i pause it stops my audio after a while the beta was better i was using this for audio books now its completely useless : 

input: when connecting to a chromecast subtitles are lost ive tried a few models and the same result occurs subtitles inside the container file are ignored used to work on the last revision iirc : 

input: why isnt there a feature to hide certain directories so they dont appear in vlcs list of media i have unwanted voice memos and ringtones appearing in my list of audio files and theres no way to hide them without deleting the actual files : 

input: while any video played in hevc format the video stops and audio plays continously after some times it plays normally and again this problem is been faced im using kitkat android os will that be the reason for this bug : 

input: swiping on songsalbum view in full screen always scrolls the page away fix it please its the worst thing about this app4219 edit still does it just not as bad 53119 maybe add in a option to lock the scroll down on album view so it no constantly showing the songs list : 

input: its a far cry from the pc version no loop play or playlist cant remove file title at start makes this app useless for me i had my hopes up but no just a basic video player : 

input: after all these fixes it still doesnt recognize when i add new videos to my phone i have to go into settings and uncheck media libraries folder and check it again for it to load my videos even that is not 100 guaranteed to work : 

input: in mx player when the video is runnig we can see the video time remaning time battery life etc in the up corner or down if thos could be added in vlc too and also all the video of a folder can be played just by taping next button then the vlc player will be parfect : 

input: stopped updating this after it demanded microphone access no idea why it would need this since it does not record anything have vlc gone in to the espionage business i do not know old version is still great : 

input: i like this app but disappointment with lack of effects for example while device in auto rotation mode the player effect is not that much smooth while changing video orientation also features like remembering last played media in each fooder is missing : 

input: the one item really missing is if you temporary fixed the audio delay then why not complete the task by implementing the adjustment also the is no definition except by chance the audio delay is saved for the session booooo : 

input: current version does not use full screen for audio playback in horizontal orientation very annoying it would also be improved if audio could use swipe gesture for seeking as video does also resume audio does not always work : 

input: since recent new updates vlc is better than ever before updates when i clicked on audio or video i used to have a list of former files which wasnt on my phone anymore but now it isnt the case anymore glad to have had useful updates : 

input: it can load any of my videos unless i look for it in d directory after i check my file mangeand update didnt fix anything ive used it on my other phone and it is d best video player ive have but i cant recommend it until u fix it and im only giving u 5 stars bcus i want you to fix it quickly i want my best video player back : 

input: doesnt handle accepting external links from other apps well android 10 : 

input: i spent a good half hour trying to disable autoplay when my phone connects with the car via blutooth such a simple function should be obvious and if i am missing something please let me know in the meantime i will uninstall : 

input: i always loved vlc but it is so not user friendly if i just slightly touch my screen it rewinds or zooms and if that happens i cant watch the rest of the video the sound plays in the background but the video itself freezes : 

input: most of the time vlc is unable to detect the media files on my android phone i keep cleaning cache every thing to show the media files but failed to do so even right now vlc is not showing the movie i have in my android : 

input: the update is horrible i cant control the size of the player meaning it leaves no ability to use androids on screen buttons : 

input: used to love this app has begun to go downhill fairly quick one moment i am able to cast to my tv the next it says my media cant be found after reinstalling 5 different times im done : 

input: doesnt show specific folders with mp3 cant parse media in it even after renaming the folders : 

input: vlc is the best video player by far thank you 5 edit bug in new version signs show everywhere when selecting group videos by folder in directory names edit 2 i fixed it i did this by going to settings media library folders and unckecking all video folders and then rechecking them  : 

input: sorry to say but the new update sucks that one star is for new update else the old one was a five star : 

input: very very good app since its launch i havent been using any other media player app except vlc : 

input: excellent best video app for android so far but then again i havent installed any 3rd party video players yet so hahaha : 

input: fantastic developers who dont hide features behind a pay wall hats off : 

input: this update caused the app to crush and it wasnt working at allhad to uninstall and reinstall the app : 

input: im using many applications to play videos but non of them is like vlc : 

input: vlc was my favorite player all the timebut nowadays it doesnt download subtitlesit always shows subtitles not found i am unable to get even a single subtitle for the past 2 months i thought its a bug and tried to update the app but still i am facing the issue  : 

input: when i download new videos and delete the old ones it still shows the old videos that cannot be played since i deleted it and new videos are no where to be found no matter how many times i refresh this sucks : 

input: works great for watching videos but its terrible at playing music music sounds weird on this player like it slowly starts to switch the tone back and forth and after many updates it still the same : 

input: no gapless playback seriously this is something ive had since winamp on xp and in 2019 the developers behind vlc still cant figure out how to implement gapless playback pathetic : 

input: good player but consider adding feature to play videos in full screen mode even with notch my phone has a notch and this player is not showing video in notch area : 

input: can we go back to the previous version the app now freezes and stops every three minutes or so it is very annoying and if not fixed fast it will make many people stop using this fix in fast : 

input: great software on the pc but its disappointing on android it just seems too cloggy and subtitles dont work at all when casting in fact it pretty much struggles a lot when casting : 

input: i dont like the android tv interface having the options like on full android would be great also has unfortunately been crashing on a lot on playback that mx player has no problems with : 

input: resisting update until confirmed that casting to chromecast is provided some updates ago we were advised it was being removed and to be then returned ive not since read anything to suggest it has been returned : 

input: when deleting files the app sometimes doesnt update the list and i need to literally delete its cache to fix it its awful definitely worse than mx player but at least it had no ads : 

input: really the best media player i have ever seen it lets you to acess all media files on your device but all formats of vedio cant be played please fix this thats the only drawback : 

input: i have problems with the app but it is amazing how people can trash talk the most free app on the play store every other app is paid for or has ads vlc is 100 free i dont know whaf benefits they get from giving us free app : 

input: its pretty buggy when casting i have to say sometimes it errors some times the casting lags its very hit and miss shame there isnt an alternative : 

input: videos recorded in portrait on phones cant be rotated in android tv version why leave out such an important function most home videos are recorded on phones and many people dont think to film in landscape : 

input: the general app is great plays almost everything except for ts files when playing ts files the video breaks for both android and windows vlc i think this should be resolved in the next update : 

input: why does the progress bar remain short when turned in landscape mode when playing audio in this latest update i listen to files of podcasts audiobooks etc that are a few hours long and it is now even harder to scroll to a specific time : 

input: group videos are totally a mess in vlc its not showing clear folder and folder names like mx player i wonder how you guys didnt solved this issue i installed it over a year ago and uninstalled it because of this issue and i give it a try again today but am going to uninstall again : 

input: generally good but new update has got rid of audio eq please bring it back i dont want to have to go looking for a new media player : 

input: app always stops working and force closes randomly parses media which takes forever will randomly double songs for an entire album so that you cant listen to an album straight thru without listening to each song twice : 

input: its a good app but after clearing my phones memory the old thumbnails still shows up and deleting it doesnt work also new videos dont show up after refreshing uninstalling it for now : 

input: i am using this aap last 2 to 3 year but latest update also generate some bug in it so please tell your developer and tester resolve this issue and launch new update asap edit new update resolve some issue in vlc app but some issue still there check again and solve all issue : 

input: im using pixel 2 xl with android 9 and the app runs sometimesvery rarely if it does and if pause the video and do some other things like whatsapp and return to the app the app crashes after that if i use open the app it never opens : 

input: been using vlc for android for years and just in the last few months i have to wait half an hour for parsing seemingly every week i only use vlc about 3 hours a week so im wasting a lot time with this will just delete and replace with another app if it continues : 

input: in last dacades this app is gonna to be awesome but android is a cheater and also some horrible incident happened some times it is flop as better some times it is the worst in the world this made to others so dont try this kilometres and kilometres away the origin of the app the inventor of this made by chellapan the name was deveried from vallasala : 

input: vlc crashes after exiting app for extended period of time over 5 minutes or so have to navigate back to the video scroll back to where i stopped watching very inconvenient : 

input: when it works it works fine unfortunately prety soon every installation stops updating the video library and the video files can only be opened from the explore my files folder also is there a way to enqueplaylist files and i missed it : 

input: finally a music app that will play wma files its also ad free my only complaint is that there is no way to change the album art for my music at least a lot of the album art is wrong or missing : 

input: not a good music player forgets my sd card library all the time i cant find the equilizer setting i liked overall a difficult experience for me found a much better replacement player : 

input: was working great but now it no longer detects my pc i can still force it to play the video through esfile explorer but it constantly interrupts in an attempt to search for the lan works on all my other media players but vlc is my favorite  : 

input: with the video video playlist mode option it does not do anything when selecting a video in the directory view i would like it if it could create a playlist from that video and all videos in the directory : 

input: need to restart the video if it is minimised in between the video there is no feature to see if the video is already watched all the folders need to be traversed to see the videos instead only videos need to be displayed : 

input: really wish you would include a folder option as not all tracks are properly tagged and with a few 100gb of music it sucks to have half a cd in the unknownvarious artists folders id be willing to rate 5 stars once a folder option is included : 

input: great app overall especially the multi format playback the only reason for 4 stars is for me it drops the place where the audio was manually paused and starts from the beginning of the file for lengthy files it is quite annoying : 

input: it has been horrible since the last update : 

input: after i update app started getting this message every time i boot the phone android is startingoptimizing app 1 of 1 this goes for some time before phone finally boot phone working great without this app have been very happy with vlc for many years hope thay will fix problem : 

input: cant find an option to add external audio to the movie and i think audio delay time should be able to be edited with keyboard thanks : 

input: love the app but the latest update screwed up everything for me in video my files are all grouped up in list when i wanted it grid form and i didnt want to use unsorted videos cause that just makes it harder to find what i want to find : 

input: good but i dont like the hidden update that turned the orange interface buttons into white please change it back : 

input: the app now hangs the previous versions used to function time to download something else : 

input: the latest update removed the sort by recently added why lose the simple useful sorting system the new ui not even pretty why are you devolving : 

input: the subtitles refuse to download an orange rotating circle and thats all not worth it : 

input: i used it before and it was the best but now it doesnt scan every song from my mobile : 

input: not happy with the app at all after updating it it does not open : 

input: slow to download               : 

input: its interface is not user friendlymx player is quite simple than it : 

input: cant download subtitle easily it so annoying : 

input: whats wrong with vlc after the update my videos are not loading even after repeated refreshing whats showing are some few whatsapp videos and some camera clicked videos only n the rest no matter how much i try refreshing its d same not showing in the app kindly look into it : 

input: everything is superb only problem is whenever i switched of the screen or resume the video again i have start it from the beginning everytime this happens : 

input: good app when using your phone but terribly unstable when casting to a chromecast the app continues to disconnect and you have to skip to where you were before : 

input: great app love the fact that i can customize soo much unlike some apps ive used but why does it pause when i switch apps plays for a couple of seconds and then it pauses : 

input: i think vlc represents what it is video and audio quality is perfect but i can find repeat function for audio and video : 

input: ever since i started using the android version it keeps losing connection to chromecast like a lot it stops up constantly had no issues on my iphone using the apple version : 

input: i love vlc player but this new update is really troublesome it works good for a while then it does not pick up my memory card when i go to settings to select the memory card it ticks it but after i exit settings it reverts back please fix this  : 

input: womt connect to any of the 4 other devices in my network even using the same app on all the devices only thing its good for is viewing downloaded files as my pos phine didnt come with a pdf viewer : 

input: equalizer is moved in 42019 update without notice equalizer is now in the big menu on the main play screen with the control buttons the small menu on the media list screen only has refresh : 

input: new ui is the worst grouping not working name truncated need third party tools to delete subtitle files i dont need thumbnail video list with filename is enough and please fix the ui you are aging but you dont need to look uglier : 

input: latest update has many bugs can we have the old one back please why do developers constantly break things that were working fine instead of breaking video playback on reopening the app why not make the android app as good as the ios version : 

input: very poor will play lots of formats but its full of bugs the worst of whick is the search function whick gets stuck it then continues to play whatever part of the track it wants uninstalled : 

input: reporting a bug weirdly when i tilt my phone to change the view from horizontal view to landscape while playing a video it suddenly stop playing and have to select again the video to play : 

input: its great but every time i minimize it to open another app the music stops playing thats very annoying that it always needs to be open in order for it to play music : 

input: i do like vlc but please if can and would when playing a mp3 file please have all the same options as you would if playing mp4 video file also please if can and would have an option to remove noise and balance for at least left and right channels : 

input: good app to watch video files but it seems to be a resource hog running it on my nokia 7 plus works ok until i minimise the app phone struggles to display home screen and do anything for a couple of minutes vlc is the only app in app tray : 

input: its awesome my only problem is that most times when i minimize and come back it does not start from where i stopped like before 2 vkc has refused to load my media files i now have to use directory to play my media : 

input: on a brand spanking new moto g7 halts mp3 playback minutes in hangs with no notification or error at all and refuses to resume playback unless the app is terminated and restarted rinse lather and repeat completely useless for android devices : 

input: im a huge fan of vlc for a very long time but i cant give it 5 stars on android sadly the mobile version doesnt support recording streams or taking pictures id like ro record the rtsp stream from my ip camera : 

input: never update or fix your app how can i put no stars app is great until you want to close it when a video is playing then it doesnt want to close no matter how i try and have to force close it in settings why is this : 

input: i downloaded vlc and my whtsapp and many files started bugs and hang out and after i uninstall vlc it got all cleari did it many time to confirm whether it is because vlc or other but results same alwaysplease let your users now about safety and please let it out from this we dont want to loose vlc it is good but nowdays it is not performing good all files are insecure and bugs holds : 

input: vlc is the best no ads etc problem faced is the subtitle path isnt remembered once you minimise the app and go back to it you cant use the select the subtitle option ill have to close the app restart then select the sub never used to happen before : 

input: needs a lot of work integrating with chromecast eg only displays the first 3 devices i have 5 will be adding more also the timeout on the phone screen is pitifully short when casting : 

input: this app is incredible especially when a movie you want to watch an anime for example doesnt have a subtitle all you gotta do is download the subtitle file and it will automatically be added to the movie : 

input: the last update from november 27 broke the scaling of the ui no way to delete videos from the app anymore : 

input: the best player to use only improvement id say is it doesent like converted video ts files on my android box but desktop version plays them so maybe you could get that sorted out then ill be able to play them 910 but 10 if ts files played : 

input: please add global audio delay i dont want to set this per video : 

input: cannot turn it off and it inteferes with my daily work : 

input: it took almost a day to get download for no reason even when there was high speed : 

input: gooood but so much slow at times and makes some videos to crush 5050 is better : 

input: downloaded this app and it left a virus until i downloaded this app my phone was fine i dont recommend this app : 

input: it got hang while palying vedio i can only listen audio but i can not vedio : 

input: no loop player on my           : 

input: you doesnt fix the bug subtitles not found when this issue will be resolved if it not fixed then lot for your users and me tends to uninstall this app and prefer the app better than yours : 

input: last major update went in wrong direction have used this app daily for years last update broke the sleep timer function emailed developer they never replied i would have paid for this app it was so good previously : 

input: the app is very good almost all format are supported but it consumes so much battery my 100 charge finished by watching only 60 min vidoe in it whereas i watched 3 whole movies in my android player : 

input: previous version was great but the update is not working properly not able to fast forward or vice versa and play or pause button shows incorrect and option wont be available when playing many many bugs resolve asap : 

input: great program but you broke the sleep timer on this latest update edit 103119 the sleep timer works again but if im listening to a stream and use the timer theres no way to use the program or exit it until i force stop the program : 

input: everything is fine except whenever i listen to something and pause it and get back to it again it closes the player and does not start from where i paused and its really annoying : 

input: go to directories and you will not be able to see the actual name of video files instead of that you are going to see the website names from where the content belonging its very irritating because i am unable to find the video i want to watch vlc you need to learn some guru tips from mx player : 

input: pretty good however it needs to be able to be moved onto the phones sd card plus needs to clean up after itself when exiting such as get rid of snapshots and clean up cache : 

input: something changed recently whenever i tap to show the ui during a video the video shifts to the side to accomodate the homeback soft buttons showing up it didnt do that before : 

input: i knew vlc as the goto player on a pc but on my phone it has many bugs the latest is that the playlist option no longer appears i create playlist but cant use it : 

input: used to be great but now it takes forever to scan the directories every time the app starts otherwise file locations are not accessible audio artists list is buggy and not showing the names : 

input: no ads or inapp purchases plays anything you throw at it ps if you have problems with choppy video go to settings audio audio output and change it to opensl es and then restart vlc it should fix it right away : 

input: ive liked this player since the time winamp got cut pretty much my favorite media player so far some issues still like recently it got stuck on the last track it played and would not changed until i reinstalled it : 

input: it is a great app i love it but i hate interruptions when watching something auto rescans is shut off but it still does while im watching something and it restart the app i hate that kindly fix it : 

input: im really disappointed ive always loved vlc its been my goto for playing any kind of video and now i install this version and its not playing anything except as a audio file update reinstalled because it was crashing now it wont play anything at all : 

input: i always have to go back to my directory to get my files played even after updates on updates i use an infinix phone and its always frustraring video files usually gets refreshed on opening wish i can get that back : 

input: usually love it but it hasnt been finding all my media files when i refresh theyre in the correct directories but they arent showing up was hoping the latest update would help but have still got the same problem : 

input: when i told you about the video not showing up i just had an idea it was reinstalling the app to remove the problem and it reset the whole app to make my video show up and guess what it worked : 

input: great for playing videos and multimedia but increase brightness gesture seems to be broken whenever i try to increase the video brightness a bit it bumps up to 100its annoying : 

input: i give it a three stars on my android put on my pc it doesnt perform half as well on my pc i can play dvds and i can find my amazon music on there and play that as well as on my windows media player but i downloaded a lot of videos onto my android vlc and i cant find them on my pc vlc why is this and can i rectify this situation so they sync up forecast from android to my pc device rsvp : 

input: will you believe if i say that my android phone app was updated with my android tv app in my phone maybe because both places i have signed in with the same mail id so that i can access my content at both the places in contuinity so i had to uninstall and reinstall the vlc app on my android phone and it worked fine but what if the issue repeats but this never happened with youtube and now im quite afraid if this will happen with other android apps which im using on both my devices : 

input: great app but im horribly missing the ability to skip video 10s forward or back by double tapping with the recent updates : 

input: im not able to download subtitles and sort list is really messed up and also slowed plz solve the problemworst update  : 

input: it did what i needed it to do had a couple of old video files that i couldnt get to play with other players :

input: problems accessing pcs could not access any of my pcs even though they appear on the network get the busy icon forever with no error messages and no settings to change if i cant access the pcs then this app is usless to me : 

input: i am unable to download subtitles automatically the next update should please focus on improving subtitles and its download for example mx player has really good subtitles repository overall its a good app ill recommend it : 

input: sometimes it doesnt show files names instead of it shows the website names and video names are correctly shows in information please add an option like show video file name forcefully add an option scan videos only but not audio : 

input: a recurring problem i have is the play button will not reliably stay toggled most of the time it turns itself off i tried the settings but found nothing that works very annoying : 

input: its a pretty decent media player definitely a go to but i have one complaint and its that subtiles dont show up when im casting to my tv it shows just fine when im not casting if this issue could be resolved id appreciate it : 

input: has a bug with subtitles only has the option to add them manually and while filling out the title and season it closes before you can enter the episode number other than that excellent app : 

input: in this november update the eq isnt powerful i dont like it i used to use this app precisely because of the great and powerful equalizer now the bass that come out from vlc is simply bad and not deep : 

input: cant even chromecast properly always stops casting when the phone is turned off sometimes the chromecast button doesnt even show up sometimes the video on the tv disconnects and i cant get it to connect again too buggy to be used properly : 

input: my experience is that while listening to music audio is always intermittent almost as if the player is unable to read file i use vlc on my pc but only on android is the audio intermittent : 

input: i dont know why but vlc keeps scanning my internal memory for the media library everytime i start it even though ive checked the auto rescan on startup setting and in the process it renders my phone useless eating up literally the entire cpu : 

input: i do like vlc but as an audio player it has an annoying bug that causes it to speed up and slow down during music playback not by much and maybe some people will never notice it but its quite conspicuous to me : 

input: poor app for viewing folders doesnt list the videos by date doesnt have manual zooming : 

input: download subtitles option crashes very often : 

input: downloaded vlc with great expectation but it couldnt play 4k videos : 

input: it takes time to get subtitle but it really nice : 

input: i am not being able to download substitles in vlc after the new update :

input: this one star is for the current update it has spoiled the experience resume timer does not work properly i dont understand what rhis update was for : 

input: fails to update playlist each time i delete or download a new video at times no content is displayed at all installed uninstalled it a couple of times now im just done : 

input: good but has issues it does not ask for deleting permissions and hence fails to be useful for deleting and does not properly refresh for the most part : 

input: dark theme is just useless for amoled coz its not really black it is gray tint also when i pass and play after 2 mins or so its starting from first then why do i have a pause button you could just give stop button : 

input: forwarding is very poor nd slow whenever we need to forward a scene it forwards in second this issue should need to be solved it should be forward along with movement of finger : 

input: im trying to scroll through my list of videos on my sd card and it keeps jumping back to the beginning of the list i cant get much past the es before it jumps back maddening : 

input: it doesnt upload always the subtitles very annoying apart from that im very pleased as it plays all kinds of videos :

input: i was using google music player until i discovered it couldnt handle wma files without my jumping through hoops vlc handles wma out of the box and it keeps my folder structure which google doesnt do thank you videolabs : 

input: i loved this app however after the last update it stops playing mp3 audio tracks at 1 minute every track with this format just doesnt play further uninstalled : 

input: this player doesnt have an option to skip to a particular part of the song are you kidding me what a joke even my bundled player i can only access through storage can do that : 

input: new update not showing any subtitle tried many times but no subtitle showup this problem happen after new updates please fix this asap i spent lot of time watching movies on my phone this update ruined everything good about vlc android : 

input: cant stop and restart audio theres actually only a pause button the app fights you when you try to restart a single song very disappointed for such a mature application : 

input: doesnt properly close pause audio close app click play on headphones and it starts vlc audio again instead of the running audio player so clearly vlc is running in the background and not really closingforce quit doesnt even stop it : 

input: works well but the playback buttons gets under the navigation buttons of the os which hides automatically and comes back when you interact with the screen kinda annoying : 

input: cant even go to the folder and tell it to play this one forgets all music i have to reboot phone to make it find it again didnt used to have to do that im uninstalling until i find out its fixed : 

input: straight up crashes when attempting to play any music or videos rubbish update : 

input: is there an option to roll back to previous version volume gesture doesent work wont fit to screen without cutting off video im sorry but this wasnt beta tested : 

input: it was working fine now all the music in my favorite files are gone and i cant retrieve them : 

input: subtitles not loading when cast on tv illogical i say : 

input: my only issue with this player is the audio pitch bent that happens every time an audio file starts playing and theres no way to prevent it : 

input: only major issue is avi format files are not playing smoothly a bit of frame drops and glitches in audio too no ram or display issue because most other format video files are playing smoothly : 

input: ive always used and love vlc but what happened to the popup window option settings have pictureinpicture mode turned on but doesnt work 5 stars if you fix this : 

input: good but it frequently crashes on my 81 android phone : 

input: the interface is so hard to work with its a dice roll to see if i can successfully queue another song or start playing it and delete the play queue ive set up the most recent update also wiped all of my playlists : 

input: new update made it worst now double tapping in centre doesnt pause the video and double tapping on sideways doesnt skip 10 seconds or replay it : 

input: cannot download subtitles and cannot select subtitles eithereverything works fine before updating : 

input: its does not open the mkv video format : 

input: keeps randomly saving video progress and if you add it to playlist it starts from that point : 

input: very good audiovideo app though like everything it isnt perfect my issue is a minor one with files that i remove still showong up in the search though simply reinstalling the app fixes it : 

input: downloaded music is not being updated in song list of vlc player hence cant be located for listening other music appbis showing it automatically but vlc player has failed despite manually refreshing the list several times : 

input: just downloaded this app in the hope that subtitle online search is working as its not on mx player presently unfortunately no just keeps showing try again later : 

input: app refuses to recognise standard music formats including mp3 about 70 of the time get your act together the pc version of vlc is great this is trash : 

input: this was always my go to app for videosuntil now just suddenly stopped casting to my android tv connects to tv but will not cast disappointing : 

input: best player period was in beta but last ver had bug freezing ui after change of screen orenintation play stop skip ect function just progress bar and now playing and all lock up : 

input: great when it works but it seems to have trouble adding new music to playlists and reading from the sd card : 

input: stop deleting my playlists and ill give you a better rating im constantly dealing with songs being randomly deleted from the playlists ive made and have even opened playlists to find them empty of the content i put in there fix it this is getting old : 

input: dear team post the new update the smb function has stopped displaying the contents of network devices please arrange to fix it thanks : 

input: one of the best video player the album art in the audio are so blurry and it looks so weird and not clear at all : 

input: it has a very big issue while casting videosvideo stops every 34 minutescomplety destroys the mood to watch videossomtimes it connect to chromecast and some times notplease solve this problem at earliest : 

input: it seems pretty great but the main problem i have is i need to customize my music file names on the go and cant i had to download a file manager itd be nice if everything was in one place : 

input: why media player requires access to device microphone it should play video not record it previous version was much better this one was removed : 

input: unable to shuffle playlists artists or albums this is a pretty important feature in a music so i wont be using vlc for now : 

input: changing orientation causes the screen to minimize to a floating window and restart the video fitting to the screen causes subtitles to be cut in half on 189 screen ratios its really buggy : 

input: love the app for the most part and have used vlc on many different platforms over the years the current android app only gets 3 stars though due to one glaring idiotic feature playlists disappear every single time the app updates dumb dumb dumb : 

input: after the last update the app is unable to create a library from the files in my phone it just plays stuff through the directories tab not from the audio tab : 

input: it been changed the actual layout is now horrible no actual way to put files in order or search them properly the old lay out was brilliant and also the files parsing everyone it connects to a new wifi is ridiculous and not needed : 

input: i have tried many video player which also can use as a mp3 player but i couldnt find out any other player like this just love it it works very well in every different other os : 

input: please give option to see videos from latest to old right away instead of sorting by selecting date two times its frustrating ill rate 5 once this is done : 

input: it was a great app that i used for everything now it refuses to open unless i give it permission to use my microphone : 

input: sorry for 3 star dev i found some bugs when play video i tlit the screen and then force close love your hard work dev wishfully in next update the problem solve sorry for my english b4 its not my main language : 

input: im facing only one problem when i delete a video it didnt delete it still in the list until i remove the app then download it again please fix this issue its since long time : 

input: yeah it sucks now something is very wrong with it ive been using vlc for a long time now and with the resent update nothing is like it is anymore : 

input: wonderful player and interface but cannot read some video files in my collection particular problem with mkv files reduced another star because it does not stream encoded subtitles : 

input: worked fine but suddenly i cant watch vids anymore i get a casting screen even though im not connected to any other device to cast : 

input: pro its like advanced media player whenever i edit the equalizer watching popoff video while doing something on other app con the songs on playlist doesnt replace instead it added the same songs which i didnt appreciate that : 

input: the recent update was not helpful makes music file that are not mp3 non responsive to command even music format with mp3 wont play its so frustrating : 

input: i installed vlc because it never showed any ads but it turned out to be too buggy that i had to switch back once i open a subtitles the buttons become unresponsive the ui constantly crashesetc : 

input: i give him 5 star on first time to any app on play store because vlc player is very stronger audio codecs any other app just like max player max player is good but some in vedii they show audio codecs problem that way the vedio play but no sound : 

input: quit auto playing when i connect to bluetooth also forgets what its playing if you switch to another app for more than a minute or two checked settings and theres nothing telling it to close : 

input: i use vlc on my windows and linux computers but the app just doesnt have the flexibility of the computer programs and has trouble with a couple formats i use switched to mx player though still very fond of vlc : 

input: not laggy and display my videos with good quality the app is light there are some confusing features though i dont need to use them that much : 

input: good appit would be alot better if it also had the option of providing the songs through their respective folderslike my downloads in downloads of vidmate otherwise you have to go to it through the directory which is inconvenient : 

input: i have to keep uninstalling and reinstalling coz one time its able to load media file yet another time it just jams almost fed up with it please dev why do you think this happens or could it be only me having such an issue : 

input: i hope therell be an option of custom sort or alphabetically sort files in playlist and that it wont make duplicates if one file is added twice or if we could delete the duplicate without deleting the file off the list completely  : 

input: why does playback speed still not work past 110x speed without timestreching audio enabled in advanced settings this bug has been present since the release of this app the old vlc beta app that is no longer available didnt have this problem : 

input: 2 disgusting points 1 imposes an extra warm tone on any videos as a result the actual video colours are lost no option to manually control it 2 video looses sharpness significantly a 1080p video looks like 720p : 

input: new update is so worst you cant download subtitle they only shows but you cant download it : 

input: awesome app just fix the play issue after sleep timer : 

input: i faced a problem on viewing video in portrait mode pause next and all other bottom icon are overlapped by my navigation virtual key back home screen recent and im unable to touch next pause or any other icon : 

input: nice software but on my phone the vlcs sound is just like too loud and breaks down and get scrambled at all volumes the phones own music player works well although the volume is higher unusable for music playing : 

input: this app has the benefit of control on screen however it cant be set up to be default video viewer this means i have to set individual defaults it would be desirable to have this feature : 

input: after update very hard to double touch for skip sometime not work : 

input: plays everything jerky and it randomly freezes and pauses even things that play fine in other apps : 

input: i like it because you can customise it but the only problem is that it cannot play in the background : 

input: recently vlc started burning up my phone trying to parse files no option to turn it off and never sends to complete : 

input: i dont know about this app because iam just downloading this but i used it in pc in according to pc it was an agood video player but in this time tjis was coming to android and download what idont know how its performense and how it work iam exited to this and waiting for instaling : 

input: excellent app but the subtitle option is not better than mx player : 

input: will reinstall when the blank screen glitch is fixed : 

input: good app but a few bugs with new version ver vlc 312 revision 4e0ea776c vlc 94bc8e707 at this time my biggest complaint is the sleep timer no longer works pls fix asap : 

input: when i try to play a video for the second time from usb drive app force closes and app data needs to be cleared becore i can play the same file again please look to it my device is redmi 2 : 

input: in this app 164 video size is not supported zoom option also not in this mx and x player have zoom options for videosso in that apps we can zoom and watch in my mobile full screen but with this app i am not satisfied : 

input: great app provides all controls snd features i want that is until most recent release now it does not recover from minimizing and then after restarting it loses prior video position running on pixel 3 xl : 

input: its a great app but its got one issue if i dont delete a video using the app it fails to remove it from the collection : 

input: just got a new tablet the video software that came with it wouldnt play audio from my dash cam footage installed vlc and got just what i needed honestly the interface for android is way better than the interface for pc : 

input: crashing after 1020 seconds of play video type doesnt matter tried reinstallation with no luck older version was more stable : 

input: downloaded solely to play music from my local nas attempting to connect fails to prompt for username and pass making it impossible to connect : 

input: the playlist doesnt update i copy new files and delete old files despite pushing refresh many times the old files are still there and the new files dont appear : 

input: this app isnt working properly it cant play any of my videos and worst of all it tends to stop working please i would really appreciate if you could fix this bug thanks : 

input: playing a movie or song pausing it for a few minutes and vlc forgets where it was and resets back to start of file such a basic bug seriously anmoying cause you have to search where u were pleeaseee fix : 

input: vlcnothing more needs to b said no ads or bs i use nothing else on my desktop now il b using nothing else on my phone to play movies listen to music any format ive never had a problem  : 

input: i want to be able to reorder an audio playlist not jsut have the songs in the order they are added also have playlist as an option in the header beside artist album genre : 

input: if it aint broken dont fix it annoying file names now keep moving making it hard to read and you cant disable it : 

input: all in all a good app it has some issues with updating the library with the files in the folders and with upnp where itll stall loading folders or even libraries : 

input: cant stream youtube videos copying url method doesnt stream only loading : 

input: in the newest version it will not rotate my videos horizontally and just stay in a vertical video play what gives : 

input: i very like it because dont have ads but it hard to find video and mp3 while xplayer can find easily other things is that it cant play all videos as audio so i uninstall : 

input: i used this since 1 year but now it does not work when playing any vedio i can not see any picture only sound please fix this problem i am using updated version  : 

input: this is kind of an unnecessary legacy app because all stock video players play all the formats vlc does in 5 years ive never needed to use it not sure why i keep it installed : 

input: great app but hangs play store by staying stuck in a loop installing must kill the process b4 installation of updated or new apps can begin love it on linux but on android it needs some work : 

input: im using moto g6 plus android 9 im having this issue that when app is switched i cant come back to vlc it shows an error msg i have to restart media file from gallery or file many otherwise it was perfect app : 

input: recent update screws up playlists and browsing i have a folder with 700 files in it and vlc cant seem to count them sometimes it say 200 others 400 and sometimes 700 but still less than the actual number : 

input: can no longer access local network folders via smb app has been deleted as it is now useless : 

input: its just about the same as any other app out there it doesnt differ at all it looks like they are all based on the very same principle thus i guess its the name why i went for it instead of some other app : 

input: last app update has wrecked vlc everyone agrees fix it please doesnt work with phone ringtones anymore totally pissed off : 

input: not good enough im hearing dot noise in headphones when playing movie : 

input: all are perfect but equilizer should be of only 5 bands with perfect fx : 

input: lots of bugs in 1gb ram phone when i go back to play another video its freezing i need to exit the app to play again so annoying : 

input: its not showing all the videos i have please fix it : 

input: just one problem when i remove songs they remain there or pc i add music it wont : 

input: i use vlc on my fire tv the videoloaded in vlc stutters alot : 

input: no auto video default rotation detection feature available : 

input: dear sir i want to say that in this app there is some issue like when i play any movie after few minutes if i minimise the vlc again i play movie from vlc they do not start again please solve this issue : 

input: very bad loading all the gifs and such from whatsapp and all other apps this takes ages and the app force closes several time trying to accomplish this on my 128gb microsd very unconvenient in all aspects please save your time and keep searching for that video player : 

input: keeps crashing adding multiple songs into a playlist easy when new songs are added to the phonethey dont always show up in the app easily : 

input: great when it works requires frequent reinstalls though as it loses track of all songs etc on my sd card and wont allow me to rescan them without a complete reinstallation : 

input: i cant watch videos on this but sounds on background it was okay before updated version is showing such problem : 

input: a great free app the developers have created this app for nothing and all they ask for is a donation i cant believe the amount of cretins that have the audacity to moan and criticise the team behind it thank god for the kindness of the vlc team and ignore all the comments from the retards who havent got the brains to appreciate what zero cost means d : 

input: keeps uninstalling without my knowledge or consent antivirus isnt the cause aside from that it works well : 

input: not sure what happened with this app it has been a favorite of mine for a while but now every time i open a new file i literally have to uninstall the app and reinstall it then restart my phone : 

input: my fav video player on most platforms always works never has issues i want chromecast support other chromecast supported video players dont have the right codecs : 

input: all rounder media player only app that have the potential to play all kind of video files as well as audio files even it plays high fedility pure audio hfpa where as poweramp google play music fails to play it : 

input: vlc really needs to add shortcut for rotate buttonfixed one therere many short videos with wrong orientation some portrait some landscape sensors dont help all the time thanks for free software : 

input: overall good video player but loaded subtitles dont work together with movie file while streaming woth chromecast tried it with different movies subtitles but doesnt load in at all : 

input: after few weeks used vlc player will hangs and unable to delete the videos if i delete the video it wont clear the video from list i have to uninstall it to clear it : 

input: why i cant give less than zero starworst appnew downloaded songs doesnt show in library untill you play it from the file managerall tracks are not playing continuously even after selecting loopnd many more : 

input: best overall but has just a single error its the equalizer it tend to reduce bass when i switch to play music after watching video please fix it : 

input: i dont know why but every time i watch a movie and then insert substitles its all flat on landscape it messes by movie experience i hope you guys can help me fix it : 

input: no doubt one of the best player but how do i stop it from showing all the non media files i can see my docs and images in the folders too only music and videos should be only visible any suggestions : 

input: it may not be the smallest app or the most userfriendly but it is the last media player you will ever need if its not in a proprietary format vlc will play it : 

input: i dont know why its lagging while playing a hd video since my phone fully supports 1080p hd format this app cant work properly please fix this problem : 

input: whats not to love about vlc plays everything you throw at it and its completely free used it on windows since it was released many moons ago android version seems to perform just as well dont look anywhere else : 

input: manage to roll back to 309 the 31 series is such garbage got back my easy accessable eq button got back the ability to add new media to vlc and actually having it show up in the list : 

input: this app used to be very good now i cannot flawlessy cast to my tv like i used to it stutters buffers audio out of sync using my computer and videostream it works flawlessly so the issue the vlc app : 

input: great app when works but have to keep unistalling it and reinstall it to appear over my other player as it refuses to work most of the time app just close as soon as try run it : 

input: its pretty great especially gor casting files to your television on the downside you can rarely resume playing it disconnects on a dime : 

input: i was fan of this media player i used it on my pc and mobile but meanwhile i needed to play the video with subtitles but vlc neither download them automatically nor loads them manually : 

input: big fan great app though the new update is in preety bad shape fast forward how do you cut out a feature like that themingetc inshort bring back some classy old features and fix the bugs excellent app : 

input: not so hot for streaming local media watching show and i press pause to answer a text go back and it starts from the beginning with no ability to fast forward or skip ahead : 

input: its nice but i also think we should be able to fast forward or rewine a clip or movie from the screen because its really hard to get to a particular point using just the buttons : 

input: this is my favorite music app but lately every time i run it the thing it scans my whole sd card parsing media for an hour or more only to do it again the next time i switch to it : 

input: i love this app but now everytime im playing something using this the sound is just annoying its not clear it makes me feel irritated everytime please please fix it  : 

input: the new version is not that visually good its annoying and it can waist my time by letting the text of the titles keep on running well the world is only getting to be fill with idiots and thats the qy it is i guess : 

input: very bad since this last update the app cannot access folders on my phone anymore which make it impossible to use the subtitles files saved before therefore make the use of this vlc worthless was using it because of how easy it was to add subtitles : 

input: there is an issue of fixing screen resolution after updating also not running smoothly ny playing a video please fixe asap : 

input: the new update broke all my playlists it wont recognize new folders and new playlists delete themselves : 

input: hi team new update is good but it lacks on sorting files missing sort by date options : 

input: cannot play error message something about files and location it sucks : 

input: too much buffering while casting waste of time : 

input: what happened to the play pause button in the notification its gone after the update and i cant restart audio streams anymore : 

input: the update is cool but 1 more thing i think it could be better after user set play speed timer the icon of it can change color like the old version this could remind user they setting something : 

input: this use to be a great app my favourite in fact now i cant even cast from in app and when i cast screen the picture on the tv is pixilated super annoyed huawei p20 pro : 

input: the playlist does not detect uploaded or deleted music on android very frustrating ive reinstalled this app a few times to get it to work : 

input: everytime i delete the videos i have to uninstall and reinstall so that the deleted videos will be removed from the view really sucks cause i really prefer this over others sucks no one even bothers to help tsk : 

input: best music player i have found so far there are no ads at all have not found a problem at all in the three years i have used it : 

input: screen turns out black on minimising and restoring back the player earlier it worked fine after i started using an external sd card im facing this issue : 

input: i would have gone for a five star but with subtitles its worstevery time its delaying for 67 sec and if i forward it delaying time is increasing which makes me feel irritated :

input: everytime my screen shuts off for a moment i need to add the subtitle again and again and it doesnt resume where i last left it :

input: theres one bug it has currently it doesnt find new videos on my device after refreshing even playing it from navigating from the file browser or the app itself : 

input: wouldnt play my videos cant understand why vlc is so popular had similar challenges with the pc version would give negative rating if such a thing was possible : 

input: hello vlc team love from india i really loved your app i have never seen any ads and have mind blowing experience before i used the mx hope you gussed i dont want to tell personally as its wrong but i loved your vlc media player but hey team i will tell some of the problems in your app i have been using it since 3 months so kindly listen 1 your app dont have seperate column in setting for not restarting the video from start we have to do it individually hey the words limit crossed : 

input: works well plays most formats but if you trim edit a video it distorts for 3 seconds at the beginning or when you resume play after forward or rewind this even happens in the pc version : 

input: i give it a 5 star rating but i hate the way it doesnt update my media library immediately when i add new songs to my phone its really annoying when i have to find the songs in my phone then play them : 

input: ok as far as it goes but the app still has a limit of 200 items when operating as a client for kodi i have over 1000 albums once this issue is sorted i would use it : 

input: its really baffling that you cant sort videos by folder no instead various different shows will group with other shows because their file names are similar making everything chaotic and unusable please make it an option to group videos by folder : 

input: can you please upgrade your subtitle delay its hard to adjust the subtitle when its 510 minutes delay because we need to wait so long bcs we only can increase it how abt you guys put a new subtitle delay option that we can set up our own miliseconds : 

input: asside from playing the local media all the other capabilities including but not limited to network streaming are useless if like me you need browsing through samba just use some other app : 

input: very good app dlna client does not work in the current version it does not read content of the directories : 

input: its great but needs a lot of improvement it shows all files in the directories whereas it should only show video files : 

input: the app keeps stopping and when you minimize the player the video just goes black when you resume it i also cant fast forward it just goes back to where i watched  : 

input: application fails to run mpg files from digital camera while vlc program on laptop works perfectly : 

input: the equaliser puts a nasty hiss on the music no matter the settings and when enabled doesnt seem to change the sound as much as other equalisers ive tried but apart from that i cant fault it : 

input: i was using mx player for years but recently had one marvel movie with low audio i used mx volume boost still low then i played it on vlc with volume boost and my headphones almost blew out cool vlc is my new go to video player : 

input: we cannot download subtitle    : 

input: network stream problem to connect internet in sufficient storage :

input: used vlc for a while although slow for conversion it worked until i updated itnow it doesnt convert my files to mp3 deleted the program now use switchquicker and easier to use : 

input: glad to see you implemented cast finally but its not working properly subtitles are not showing when casting and it randomly freezes and restarts my phone : 

input: from past 1520 days it keeps on crashing within 5min of video playback dont know the reason other video players are working perfectly : 

input: its very boring app after i was deleted video from my file than also this app showing that video also am trying to delete video from vlc app but i cant am using vlc last five years but now im facing many issues with this app finally i installed this app : 

input: good but could be better long file names are truncated in list mode an option to wrap long file names so that full names can be shown is a necessity : 

input: struggles with playing movies on chromecast stops part way through sometimes can become unresponsive when parsing data has a hard time reading data on an external storage card otherwise really good : 

input: does not play back windows media format streaming asf or wmv windows media encoder 9 connected to logitech usb cam makes great security cam for cheap simple setup vlc does not support the live stream on local network totaly bunk you should support the format thst started streaming video : 

input: doesnt work on 44 video counter runs but image doesnt change off initial view trying something else too bad i have vlc on all my other devices : 

input: wont playsees all my playlists and music from my sd card correctly when i hit play it tries then fails no matter how many times i have tried uninstalled : 

input: from the last update the app crushing while i try to play videoit only happens when i play video after go to the home page otherwise very good video play : 

input: cant detect mp3 files even though i directly pointed it to the folder in settings they play if you open them separately but dont show up in library : 

input: dont care how well the rest of the app works disable forced auto rotation if i want landscape mode ill turn on system wide rotation rewinding has a high chance of breaking videos when its done by gesture : 

input: since last update auto rescan is busted i had to clear app data from settings to start vlc from scratch also folder has 10 videos but it shows count as 9 on outside folder label : 

input: sometimes has a bug so i cant rate 5 at first time this app is so great but in when i use this app for several weeks there are some problem in it i download some videos but the vlc didnt load the videos : 

input: i think the latest update broke it it no longer detects any media files on my device so the app is pointless its been great upto this point hopefully this gets fixed asap : 

input: app interface is so cluttered i dont like the interface a bit it makes much harder to find a video in a video player than by opening it in a file manager whats even the point then : 

input: subtitles go missing after switching apps and then returning to vlc following which unable to reselect subtitle track all options on options menu become unclickable : 

input: there is a huge bug in it when we play a video in vlc from our gallery then the app crashes on minimizing and maximizing function of zooming the video is also not there like in mx player :

input: always the best on every device reads all files cant go wrong like ytf would you get anything else literally perfect edit i wish i could edit my review and give you a million stars : 

input: this is one the best android apps ever im really happy with this no ads and no bullsh t it would be even better if the screen wasnt rotated all the time : 

input: does not work it shows my videos but when i click on the folder it then says there is no media when there is and it clearly sees it i tried turning on show hidden files but no luck it refuses to show videos in my download folder ut if i go though a file manager it plays them fine : 

input: i use to love this app played all formats of files now i hate it doesnt play all my songs hell doesnt even reconize most of my albums on my sd card you use to get 5 stars from me but now 1 star : 

input: this is such a perfect music and video player i like the mode where by you can play video and do something at the same and go to home screen but the equilizer is not perfect for me : 

input: worst appvlc is really good for our desktop nut ita really cheap for android appi only play cctv video length about 90 min and when i jump to specific time or forward video its getting stop and never working any moreplease tell me developer and qa name they never tested app for max length video size : 

input: the entire reason i donwloaded this was for playing my daughters bedtime music with the screen off it worked like that a grand total of once then it stopped letting play in the back ground all together : 

input: 4 stars only because im the idiot that hadnt taken the time to learn how to use 100 percent but i love the vlc player just on the android its a little complicated for me : 

input: vlc is a great app but can you ad support for very large mp3 audio files it doesnt remember last position on a 15 hour long audio file thats 206 mb file size : 

input: really bad for playing mkv files it got my phone too hot in just 5 minutes of playing and everything became extremely laggy ive never experienced somthing like that before with oneplus5 which allow me play even the latest games smoothly : 

input: it works but isnt perfect i couldnt seem to get flac audio working without stuttering but mp3 seems to work fine : 

input: vlc has always been my favorite media player for windows now its my favorite windows media player for android too it plays everything the other apps cant if you have a media file you cant open try vlc : 

input: loved this app till the recent update now none of my albums are showing up had to add them by hand in a playlist just to listen to them go back to the old way or fix the problem : 

input: suddenly cant insert subtitles from internal storage as usual : 

input: when i cast to chromecast ultra it no longer mantain selected playbak speed : 

input: vlc is the absolute best video player ive ever used i use it on both my phone and pc everytime i change my phone i always come right back to download vlc it should come with phones already : 

input: it only plays music from the movie the movies doesnt go through : 

input: 4 stars as no app is perfect easy to use and great quality and various settings available i recommend : 

input: please fix sleep feature in the app i been using vlc for music before sleep when i wake up it still plays songs the sleep feature doesnt work anymore since the updates : 

input: it was fine until the most recent update now none of my files are listed in the media i have to go through all the directories to get any music to play : 

input: my only problem is i cannot turn off the subtitles track on my films even though i have selected no subs as the sub track got added by accident the subs dont play on other video apps : 

input: keeps automatically closing when screen is off stutters and lags and force closes many times many bugs while displaying subtitles lacks basic features like taking a screenshot :

input: cant maintain information on the music on my sd card ive grown tired of repeatedly reinstalling the app in order to get it to find my music : 

input: it was better when we would touch the screen and only controls appeared with transpert look but now it resizes the picture which is damm irritating when watching a movie and touching the screen multiple times : 

input: great app only complain is that sometimes it saves the progress of my video other times it is not i would always prefer to have my videos time where i left it : 

input: very good in general but an option to resume audio files play where it was stopped is rely missing i listen lot to mp3 podcasts and i am removing the app because of this : 

input: used to work flawlessly now every time i turn the screen the app either restarts the video from the beginning or stops playing or hangs and quit  : 

input: dont know what they did in the update but i cannot access my network from vlc on fire stick get the contact usernamepassword screen popping up sooooo annoying doesnt happen on stick with previous version of vlc : 

input: laggy and buggy app endless scan which cannot pause or stop when uncheck directories for scan it will be checked back automatically i cant use this sorry : 

input: it randomly crashes while watching video and after that i have to uninstall and install it again to continue watching any other video : 

input: wont continue where i left off and crashes if i change to whatsapp and then try to go back very very frustrating as i have to keep noting the time looking for another player : 

input: audio quality was extraordinary but there is lake off bug in video quality is below grade performance and also add some of optimization of easy to choosing folders : 

input: when playing a movie and returning to homescreen of my phone makes the vlc app crash it wont open again until i delete cache and app data but after returning ti homescreen its crashing again : 

input: used this app on all my phones in the past on the s10 however when selecting fit screen the video doesnt fill the status bar area where the camera is would be great if it filled the whole screen : 

input: at last it have group by folder but please make it have columns while in horizontal mode also i think it will be better if all of the folders didnt appear in the video menu but rather inside the folder respectively : 

input: start today its keeping eror screen eror but sound still working first i think after update will getting better but idk still not working then uninstall it since no response from developer : 

input: would like to be able to change colors of the program theme the orange isnt aesthetically pleasing for me just want a greyscale interface : 

input: i love this app but i notice when i chromecast i cant get the subtitles to get on the tv it works if i mirror my phone but then the phone has to stay onis this a quick fix  : 

input: doesnt showsupdate thumbnail of my old videos kindly fix it its very annoying to search a video or audio file without thumbnail : 

input: i love this app but for some reason songs are duplicating themselves in playlists and its really annoying me please rectify this error : 

input: its always my first choice video player but i berg to add a program which can make a capture a photo from video playing also can you add a program which can make a review for piece of video playing i can select from full video playing and save it as my short video i created for vlc : 

input: great app groups videos into easy to find folders automatically the only problem ive got is that it doesnt group my anime videos correctly and renames the files which sucks because i watch anime for that normal series : 

input: ask confirmation to resume option selected but does not work and also sound quality not good need to keep on 100 then only the sound is loud and clear even on 93 volume it works like 3040 volume still the issue continues : 

input: its not a bad app but when i change the music on my phone it doesnt recognise the files despite refreshing so i have to uninstall and reinstall the app : 

input: unlike in the past im unable to increase volume above 100 on playback and wish to know why please until now i havent had a decent feedback to my comments and wondering why please respond : 

input: the feature ab repeat isnt working well or it isnt easy to use hopefully they can fix it : 

input: its nice and useful app but the last upgrade comes buggy as hell you cant add playlists items in playlists disappear but factually they are still playable changing played item is hit or miss and there is more : 

input: ever since android 10 screen wont turn off while casting videos via miracast : 

input: audio only plays and only shows 1 frame of the vid fix this please : 

input: it doesnt work on my tablet sad may i know why : 

input: nice powerful player but subtitle synchro and subs speed control should be improved to mx player level also there is no direct sharing easy ui unlike mx and other video players poor subtitle search even manual search is much better : 

input: while this is still a good app it has a tendency to randomly delete my songs from my playlist adding them again is a real pain : 

input: i love this app but sometimes when i load new videos it doesnt parse trough them even when hitting refresh which is annoying : 

input: theres an issue i want the developers to look up to i m using huawei honor 7x and whenever i use another app while running video as an audio in background it automatically after some time stops : 

input: can u add custom subtitle so that i can key in movies name to look up for online subtitle vlc currently detects subtitle by the whole name include video extension therefore i cant download subtitle even if its out there : 

input: the videos thumbnails are present even after the videos are deleted and even after removing the video thumbnails they reappear this is ridiculous  : 

input: i downloaden the subtitles from with in the app but at first they were not coming and they came they were of some other scene hate it couldnt give less than one star : 

input: no sort by date for local fileskind of makes the whole thing useless tried again for audio no gestures or 100 volume playing audio why even have a different interface : 

input: it has great codecs i like it but how do you get the options up when playing a video even when i quit open the app from the app drawer it doesnt appear ridiculous : 

input: the media player is good and very minimalistic but media scanning is pathetic sometimes it doesnt scan some videos and other times doesnt stop previewing a deleted video even after refreshing the content : 

input: the subtitle dont add properlyit adds nd just disappear after u open some other app nd come back to vlcnd then unless you close the video it wont add again very annoying bug : 

input: exactly what ive been looking for overlooked vlc to start with dispite using regularly on the pc i should have known the android version would have everything i need aswell main use is playing media from nas : 

input:  why the eff am i not allowed to control the volume during videos with the slider instead of increments seriously other than that its a nice app version of the good old trusty vlc : 

input: the app wont stop detecting shows that arent there when i try to refresh it just shows the refreshing sign and then i cant do anything else : 

input: vlc is my go to for most but recently has become very hit and miss on android it forgets my library so when opened has to spend ages scanning my sd card it never used to do this  : 

input: cold be great but there is a second delay between the start of the video and audio very frustrating : 

input: continues to say video location error cannot be played i tried copying the file and relocating it but it still wont play on about 20 percent of my audio files : 

input: i have just one complaint it takes 1 hour to watch a 20 min video each min the video will stop for loading seriously each and every min it is becoming really inconvenient pls fix this problem other than that this app is great : 

input: ok it would be way better if you can connect and stream to ps4 and xbox otherwise apps that can do that totally beat this what the purpose of another video player when the phones default player is way better it makes this obsolete : 

input: there is a bug sometimes when i try to open the open it crashes i have ro restart my mobile for it to work : 

input: vlc is more than video player you can play online video streams add subtitles sleep timer mini player resume where you stoppedand a lot more : 

input: well its good but i dont see a reason why we have to connect to the internet for it to load the new video and i think vlc should show the name of the video as we name it : 

input: had this app for years got a new phone and now everytime i let something play in the background it randomly cuts off try reinstalling it its a really short fix : 

input: everything good except for the fact that every other video players out there allow screen recording but vlc simply doesnt : 

input: the video player is good except the searching options directories are in tatters and it doesnt let you sort by date or size : 

input: very very worst of the worst experiences in updated version 0 out of 100 even its better before updated version plz dont dont download it if you download ityour time money for net costs will throne into ganga river then your wish your die you die : 

input: i had the following problem with the music player all artists were marked as unknown artist and all albums ended up in unknown album : 

input: when using as audio player i face a bug that after pause it frequently resumes playing at different time of several seconds it is annoying when u use it for voice listening with frequent pausing please fix : 

input: good video player just one issue if using chromecast the subtitle is not showing please fix that it will be full star : 

input: my music always plays when i select from files but doesnt always save in the media player but will appear randomly i dont know why but its super annoying im looking for another app as we speak if you fix ill give 5 stars i love vlc on my cpu : 

input: this app is greatthe only problem is that it doesnt refresh playlistseven after deleting a track youd still see its name will rate it 35 : 

input: when i play any video playlist in audio mode it only plays the first one then stops in that and doesnt forward to next one how can i fix this help please : 

input: kinda buggy in many ways but its reliable in that it can accept almost every type of video format i stick in it thanks for the app devs  : 

input: works well for the most part not showing hidden files and clearing the playlist both dont appear to work at least not with android tv : 

input: can no longer browse my samba share connection to share is ok as i can still play files in my history  : 

input: sorry the 32 update is horible for me i prefer the user interface in 25 version which is much easier to use : 

input: when i fast forward my record and try to play it it just doesnt play for 23 seconds it kinda gets frustrating by time please fix it : 

input: app is amazing but i cant play my vob files dont know why any help please : 

input: why i cant download any subtitles since i updated my vlc app i can no longer download any subtitles : 

input: played the formatvideo that i needed it to play plus i deduct a star or two for ads no ads plus it plays the video i wanted played while other programs with higher ratings and ads did not win : 

input: now i cant convert any songs from my converter onto audio on this app only allows so many songs to be held on audio totally frustrating looking now for a better app that works ill pay for it : 

input: skips a few seconds after pause hard to rewind not great for downloaded voicemails and not as great as the desktop version : 

input: used to be good new update sucks cant watch anything in folders and get stucked when played as audio soo many errors uninstalled : 

input: pip doesnt work properly subtitles dont appear and the video keeps playing from the beginning if the screen is rotated or pressing home : 

input: it works perfectlybut sometimes there is a cone drawn even when im playing a videoit wont show the video but only the sound with a cone : 

input: just needs to be able to play all formats some of my music isnt recgonised and can we not have sub directories please having all my music or videos in one place is good but trying to find them is hard : 

input: the new version of vlc is to bad it is hard to operate and it dont show new videos in first time it need refresh to load those materials please solve these problems : 

input: it use to automatically detect srt files on samba shares automatically where the video file that i played is located and play it on screen now with the recent updates i have to do it manually and search for the srt file but unlike mx player it can look for the srt file on the samba server while mx player it looks for it on my local phone storage 4 stars for the improved chromecast integration though but when using chromecast it cant display the subititles : 

input: best video player for android users i am not kidding cause 99 video players dont play all the video formats and they have tons of ads which makes them worst but vlc player is really greatbetter than mx player : 

input: timer not working ive used this app for years and its been brilliant but now when i set the time it just ignores it and plays continuously the update on 29th mar at fault : 

input: once great but each update seems tomake matters worse with latest update the playpausebutton in the notification went missing i heavily use that thing now im using a different player : 

input: inconsistent file scanning odd updates poor organization inline headers for alphabet uninstallreinstall doesnt even help with scans : 

input: videos do not get removed if not available in phone says failed to delete but list grows big when casting brightness is very low and cant increase making even a full hd movie a theatre print : 

input: what the happened to dark mode i cant stand the orange it was fine earlier now the option isnt even in the damn option settings interface nothing it should be there stop removing things : 

input: sometimes when i delete some files it still shows them in the list and when you try to open them it shows some sort of error which is annoying : 

input: it can be the best video player out there but few things are missing option for viewing file names instead of metadata is missing : 

input: the app is totally awesome but i dont why the subtitles feature never works it always states service not available please fix this : 

input: 5 stars and more very accesible and on top of that its free can also play different files no ads very happy with this : 

input: it was good ol vlc now every video i watch on it runs laggy with messed up frame rate watching those on phones default video player what a letdown vlc you used to be my favorite : 

input: after new update it is not become helpfull especially in subtitle download subtitles easily can be choose but it is not show up in video the latest update is not working friendly user it worst : 

input: its irritating everytime i open its shows parsing media worst user interface all videos in single row scrolling from top to bottom more time why cant you add folder else just copy coding from mx player : 

input: stops playing music when minimized on my p20 lite used to work properly on my samsung galaxy and also it takes forever to finish scanning for media : 

input: casting fails and buffers like crazy used to work fine but now is buggy as hell switching to another player if this doesnt improve : 

input: app cant find any of my media files even though all files are selected in vlc settings and when trying to play media files from my phones download location which is also selected in vlc settings still wont play : 

input: so close it has sooo many features soo many yet it lacks basic ones like a folder view or any for of view i dont wanna see all the videos i have in my entire phone on one tab please just rip off mxplayer with the way they organize the videos : 

input: add the clear sound functionality bcs when we increase 200 volume level it ruined the music qualityvoice etc otherwise it is best in no ads categoryin uplayer there is a such function which dastrically increases the voice clearity : 

input: it is awesomebut one problemif there will be found play next option while clicking on any video that will be better : 

input: user interface is trash making playlists is ridiculous and many things are poorly designed over complicating things now i know why i stopoed using this app and deleted it thumbs down for more than a year of bad iser interfacing : 

input: it be better if vlc is only for video player because the audio still keepa playing even after i acess video and while refreshing the videos these is a music that plays for a second and stops i think it has small bugs kindly fix these : 

input: good platform but poor customer service i have emailed tech support about the non functioning sleep option without response a bit disappointing but still a decent app as long as you dont need a sleep function : 

input: i have used google play music and samsung music but vlc is far the best media player built in network share browser supports every file it should be a pre installed app : 

input: subtitles do not scale with the aspect ratio and no option to adjust the positioniong manually either it is quite pathetic did not expect this from vlc : 

input: albums songs and photos are usually mixed for example you find an adele song in taylor swift album its so anoyying and it never gets fixed : 

input: theres a huge problem i love vlc and have done so for a long time but theres a bug where you go back it doesnt reopen if you open up in your ram you have to restart the whole video and its annoyong : 

input: this last update broke an app that i used for years good job maybe ill come back if decide to fix it : 

input: whenever i try to play mkv video vlc getting stuck and only playing sound without video after google i findout vlc cant play hd video on phone :

input: ive pirated a movie movie is in avi format havent checked out the file but i did get another phone app to play movie file this app was good until this one pirated movie file im thinking this app is losing its edge unsure what app ive got to open movie file but had some noticeable hesitant about vlc : 

input: ever since version 30 has released ive had nothing but problems on android and on fire tv force closes after 5 minutes of video : 

input: sadly there is no record button like vlc pc application which is very helpful to record streaming videos there is a room for improvements to reach upto the level of mx player : 

input: not exactly sure how an app can get this bad after starting out great main features removed navigation is unnatural volume is terrible even using the in app boost guess its back to mx player : 

input: all other things are good but sometimes the deleted contained is also shown in this which is very irrirating as you click on some video and the player says this video is not found in directory : 

input: chromecast controls are completely broken works well on the device itself but dont try to cast it or anything : 

input: plays everything finds everything stored in any directory just wish it had a 30 second fast forwardrewind :

input: the app is good to use but when the videos we delete it doesnt get delete and increases storage and when it is casted on tv it doesnt show video on mobile : 

input: ive been using vlc player for a long time easy ui the only thing that disappoints me is that i cant make this player as my default media player : 

input: really solid application but the video streaming and audio streaming bar gets stuck at 211 if i try to jump to 235 or 240 : 

input: if you use the sleep timer function then it jumps always to the place where it stoped playing not to the beginning of the song : 

input: cant download the subtitles on any files i have it can search and showing some subtitles online but when you click the download button it just wont download no message no notif nothing besides that who doesnt know vlc : 

input: used this all the time but no wont even work when i click open with it flashes up for a second then closese ive uninstalled in and restalled it and still the same tho i see its not just me : 

input: works fine on my phone but not on my tablet bar moves along at the bottom as though its playing but no actual movement of the video on the screen : 

input: very bad app the same day i installed it i could barely play any audio and the only way i could play it was to click it multiple times and waitnothing thank you : 

input: its a good app but i doesnt want to load in some movies i downloaded and once it does that i have uninstall the app then reinstall iylt over and over : 

input: very frustrating that the only way to keep it from autoplaying whatever file you happened to open three months ago whenever the bluetooth connects is to uninstall : 

input: never been disappointed with vlc from pc to mobile ad free open source easy to use and never bugs out doesnt get better than that : 

input: right youve permanently earned yourself a 1 star files not being found loading medialibrary getting stuck beginning of videos and music the audio cuts out terrible app fix it : 

input: new update seemed to bug up the playback when listening through headphones and on lockscreen where the playlist will consistently stop playing randomly and needs to be manually started again at least for my j7star anyway : 

input: vlc on android works ok on android but if u pause while playing a saved movie on the device u pause and he movie wont allow you to continue where u left off in my experience anyway : 

input: vlc feels like being at home cozy and useful ps sometimes select subtitle file button disappears and only option is subtitle download do you address problems like this tia : 

input: always there dependable without all red tape etc etc etc : 

input: new design is not good sub titles not appearing or downloaded : 

input: the delete file option is just gone now i prefer deleting videos after i watch them with vlc instead of navigating the file manager will have to look for another video player until it returns if thats the case : 

input: everytime i add more than 2 or 3 songs in the memory the app doesnt update them i always need to reinstall this app to get those songs otherwise it deserves 5 stars : 

input: vlc can not display the images of the videos files in the list or grid view kindly work on it for us : 

input: the easiest player ive used    : 

input: i am using itit is good then mx player : 

input: cant see recently added movies i just had to uninstall the app : 

input: cant even open a folder in video browser after update : 

input: can play my flac song files that i ripped from my tool cds using windows media player i dont know how to add album art i suggest a visualizer with bitrate usage and bluetooth codec info onscreen : 

input: no barriers vlc media plays all files windows media player so many times will not show firewall is to controlling : 

input: when i try to speed up the video the sound crackles and jump cuts fix it : 

input: vlc has always been my go to player i use it on every device and it rarely fails to play videos period vlc is 100 the topi wouldnt recommend nothing else enjoy :

input: excellent been using this for about 18 monthsno issues yet just havent done any of the updates since i downloaded it cheers : 

input: the subtitle search is terrible dont find anything 910 times other players find 812 srt to download for the same file : 

input: i use to love vlc but now it doesnt load correctly in my nexus 6p not can i play the tracks faster doesnt work on android : 

input: not stable crashes constantly can not stream to chromecast 1 mar 19 still crashes whenever its minimized for any reason often crashes on its own too : 

input: gave it just 3 star bcoz when the permission for showing notification on lock screen is not enabled then also it shows notification of the content playing on lock screen plz fix this issue : 

input: will play anything wish videos would show up as the file name also wish there were 30 second back and forward controls but so far ahead of the other apps these wishes are minor : 

input: since the update vlc subs are not downloading even though the subs are available you have got to get it fix team otherwise everything is cool : 

input: this app is perfect but i dont know why in night mode whenever i rotate my phone during playing playing automatically stops and then gets back to videolist : 

input: its do not automatically refresh video list i have to do refresh all the time and sometimes its not show new video which is recently added even after doing refreshing its sucks : 

input: it doesnt work properly when i remove the aux jak and put it again its not playing automatic as before when i try to manually start playing again it shut down  : 

input: used to love this app unfortunately since two updates ago it doesnt properly identify videos that were removed or added to my phone even though it refreshes : 

input: its an amazing app but the cast to button is always missing sometomes its there sometimes it isnt : 

input: deleted videos still show on the list even if i refresh relaunch and clear cash i had to uninstall and reinstall for the new videos to show and for the deleted ones to disappear : 

input: keeps crashing and gets stuck on startup screen have always used vlc on my laptop and loved it on my phone it is a huge disappointment even though i have rescan unchecked it still constantly rescans : 

input: please update your app playing via bluetooth it stops when you minimize it and open another app and continues playing when you re open it please deal with this as soon as possible this happened after the update of my android os : 

input: the shuffle playlist setting is reset every time i restart the app many titles are missing in my m3u or pls playlists and im sure the relative paths are correct : 

input: doesnt working sleep timer function the application continues to run after the set time has expired : 

input: super nosey unless you tell it not to and you have to repeatedly it snoops around you device to identify everything that you have and also everything that you look at if i want an app to spy on me then i will ask it too otherwise stay out of my stuff in todays world where everyone from facebook to twitter is secretly selling all the information that they can get about their users i want to be in control of my life and not see it used on a billboard to make someone else rich : 

input: it is far too clunky for audio books never keeps it place i have given up : 

input: when im playing a 1080p video it lags sometimes even quits the video other players dont do this please fix : 

input: cant set to show filenames instead of metadata it ruins the whole purpose of using it instead of the builtin player : 

input: this new update is wrong the music stops playing every minute or so there it just happened please fix or how do i rollback the update reinstalling the app solved the issue : 

input: app is unable to play videos fully when pictureinpicture mode is set app plays videos for sometime then stops abruptly i have to start all over again fix that issue please : 

input: constant problems with media database cant update it cant save changes sometimes all elements in directory are doubled : 

input: it is an simple app it has lots of options the important thing about this app is has no ads : 

input: really amazing app been using it for years 1 small problem of the player suddenly stopping play during music play can get really irritating please can you fix it : 

input: android version plays on some mp4 files a very distorted green and pixelated display on my pixel 3a the same exact file displays fine on my chromebook and pc their support faqs dont have a solution : 

input: ive loved vlc player for so many reasons just cant stay without it its an one stop final solution for all types of file extension : 

input: hey u vlc team in my mobile theres no proper thumbnails being displayed and being a media player why does it show all other stuff when it cant open those stuff help me with the thumb nails it seriously sucks : 

input: media player automatically closes after playback and there is no option in settings to switch this off which makes replaying media or seeking near the end of a file tedius and near impossible : 

input: using it as a music player for some reason shuffle all doesnt really do a good job of shuffling music randomly : 

input: all perfect at video and music player but my albums covers are looking blurrypixelated everytime would like to see an update fixing this anyways good job for this app i love it : 

input: intense interface lag it freezes a lot and is missing a general video loop playback setting its so annoying that you must enable loop playback on every video : 

input: it is too much heavy media playersometimes it show very blurry picture and it takes so much battery power to play a videoafter watching 10 min video on vlc player my mobile temperature goes on increasing : 

input: there is a very anoying bug where after a media has been paused for some time when you press play it return to some previous playlistmedia instead of the paused media : 

input: great app but the new update is annoying as it does not allow you to group videos by folder which means finding videos is more difficult than it should be change this and you get 5 stars : 

input: i dont like the new layout of the video grid i dont like that i cant delete from the grid i dont like the darkened patches when i skip forward or back 10secs revert back : 

input: when i first downloaded it was perfectly fine but now i cant download subtitles : 

input: not smooth want more low sound control and video skip mode with seconds not good players : 

input: i hate this new version and it doesnt have equalizer build in just like the old ui the new system is terrible with sounds and im going back to old version : 

input: vlc its really amazing cause ive been trying to watch some of my downloads movies but the sound was completely mute i downloaded vlc every movie i have in my phone play well with good sound : 

input: works great on my tablet the only problem im having is that the online subtitles arent working otherwise great app : 

input: thank you for the new update you pretty much deleted all my media from the app music videos and pictures great work and now its slow and buggy : 

input: love it but i found a bug if you tap the previous button it works but the forward button doesnt work its just closes the applabel : 

input: its good but mx players is actually betyer despite the ads there : 

input: does this app even work just starts parsing then when it finish it does nothing : 

input: its just not working some songs and vedios are missing : 

input: not as good as the desktop version but still my preferred video player : 

input: every thing is alright but the voice stop when i skip 10 sec or a part from the video try to fix it in the next update thanks : 

input: so it worked fine then suddenly doesnt know how to access my sd card well that make this useless to me btw it does this after i reinstalled it : 

input: its cool but i dont know why some songs cant be found on some artists and albums and the fact that it uses the file name instead of the song name : 

input: every other app i use detect all my casting devices but this it is beyond annoyinguninstalled this mess get it together : 

input: pretty decent all around but the volume circles from 100 back to 1 and so on when i use the physical volume keys : 

input: can create video playlists but no clue how to load the video playlists no obvious load playlist option in any of my menu selections almost five stars : 

input: keeps on losing the directory i have to uninstall and reinstall for the app to remember the directory when i reboot they phone it loses the directory again : 

input: the app is excellent but can you guys maybe put sort the song in download folder with date now is only sort with name so i need to search my newest songs or remember the name it would be best if songs are listed from newer to older ones : 

input: vlc doesnt play songs immediately you have to press play many times before it plays the song then it doesnt play the next song i am using a samsung j5 prime : 

input: good app only problem is when you delete files vlc will keep the deleted file icons on the list otherwise it is fantastick : 

input: if song it doesnt play in my phone i used this app its only play when the screen is on if its off the music will stop at my phone : 

input: not able to play video properly video suddenly stops i use vlc in my pc always and its really good but this app is not :

input: i love it my favourite feature is playing a video as audio when i need to run but at 5he same time listen to an mp4 :

input: excellent music and video player but i uninstalled it because the player keep showing up on my androidwear watch and its really annoying : 

input: the codec isnt as powerful as the other software but it really easy to use software without adds : 

input: everythings working best except for subtitles everytime i exit the app i need to select subtitles again and again please help its so annoying : 

input: i used vlc on many pcs in the past but it thoroughly sucks on android especially when trying to cast to chromecast uninstalling this dog of an app before it causes me to throw my phone against the wall wish i could give it 0 stars : 

input: sorry for the 1 star this is for the subtitles are not working after i switch to another tasks and after that the subtitle menu is not at all working sometimes the instead of subtitle menu its showing common menu  : 

input: oh so you dont like the way i shuffle the playlist and decided to skip the song i better reshuffle the playlist again so you will listen the songs youve already listened :

input: metadata for flac format either works intermittently or not at all usually the latter where the only information displayed is the file name : 

input: its an overall good app but it doesnt rescan when you download new music so you have to reinstall it that sucks :

input: app is broken works around task manager displays songs that are not there will play a lot of formats but ui is not worth it : 

input: had some initial difficulty but figured out how to stream shared files on local network works great :

input: the subtitle setting is buggy it wont show subtitle sometimes and is very irritating please fix it elsewise it is good : 

input: why cant vlc remember how i sort my songs whenever i play a song then go back to the albums i have to sort it again minor missing featurebug but annoying nevertheless : 

input: disappointing cant remember simple setting such as shuffle extremely slow starting play at times as it seems to want to reprocess an entire playlist each time it plays it : 

input: perfect for chromecast except subtitles doesnt show on tv is this a bug or it just doesnt support subtitles yet : 

input: songs files double up for some reason no theyre not duplicated on my device no way to disable those stupid tips everytime you open a video : 

input: ill always love vlc but i miss when this app let you resize the pip window it used to be perfect but now its just one size :

input: this application is good but this app is not available backward and forward video option i cant video forward in application when i video is forward then video is play starting : 

input: what happened to the aspect ratio button its on my other phone but for some reason this one doesnt have it all my videos are stretched tall : 

input: good app i use it for streaming and its very good the only bad thing is when choosing subtitle the explorer window is small and it doesnt show file names completely : 

input: vlc does not remembering playback time of any video instead if i switch to other app while playing video the vlc media player goes black screen resolve this issue please : 

input: perfect since it doesnt close out automatically whenever the music is paused for an indefinite time : 

input: didnt connected to the chromecast and it froze i tried several times bit disappointing : 

input: in general is great app the only problem is that it does not erase songs that i deleted on my phone i sat autoupdate option : 

input: on my galaxy j3 the app closed out completely when using youtube on other phones i had the app just paused and i was able to resume my playlist i will see how it behaves on my moto : 

input: casting dows look better and more stable than phone wide cast but the subtitle doesnt show thats rhe only demerit other than that slow scrolling can anyone fix the non fucntioning subtitle at least : 

input: every time i press resume or play from the notification area this app fails not just on this phone either so its not hardware : 

input: videos glitch every few seconds and brek down into white squeres when it work it works well but while watching movies it didnt work at all : 

input: very good app to use but the subtitle is not working i guess thats the only set back on this app : 

input: free and works what more do you need just a few bugs like duplicating song currently playing when reordering playlists : 

input: i was loving the app for the longest time but since an article came out saying its not secure i had to uninstall it from both my devices until its secure and not a hacking threat : 

input: if only after i touch next button in repeating file mode it will start playing next file in the playlist instead of play current file from beginning it would be perfect : 

input: good program opens just about every video file only complaint is sometimes the films are put of sync on vlc but its easy to delay the audio into sync : 

input: what is the problem why the video is stopping and if i play my videos from youtube it always stops after some minutes do something abt it : 

input: i love the non add part but it cant render high quality video it always get frozen and glitches now and then : 

input: subtitles gets cropped when playing full screen it would be better if we could drag that up to the screen and place it wherever we want : 

input: worthless app if u minimize movie lets say to reply to message or switch to other app and then back again to the movie the movie is gone you are on the main menu : 

input: at times the player just wont play music just starts the song for one second then cuts it off help please :

input: full screen doesnt suit subtitle each time i use full screen subtitle goes under screen please fix this : 

input: please fix subtitles search method most time no results due to using file extension as part of the search : 

input: used it all the time then it stopped working with chromecast will give it five stars again once this bug is fixed :

input: one bad thing every action display large in the middle of the screen and makes it harder to see the movie : 

input: great player only giving it 4 stars because it wont import my music library devs is there maybe a workaround for this : 

input: awesome app just one drawback that subtitles download key is not working it shows searching but nothing come out : 

input: a little bit complicated to use it and also must to hit the songs so many time to play : 

input: please add a onetap capture frame option like in samsung video player capturing screenshots kind of degrades or adds to the file i think :

input: best video app out there plays all video formats ive thrown at it only one ive come across that plays video my smb from my router : 

input: it wont stop parsing worthless uncheck the rescan and rebooted the phone nothing major bug also can ad playlist across the top : 

input: overall app is good but not easy to use for beginners subtitle function not working when casting to a tv : 

input: forward is an issue subtitle fonts and color gone lock should not tilt screen : 

input: recently there is an issue whereby videos stop playing when the screen orientation changes most irritating : 

input: still the best the only thing is that it does not load subtitles with same name as the video automatically when opening through samba : 

input: why new permission for recording audio when you did not describe reason in update details this is a huge fail please do not respond with any standard copy paste response details fail fail fail : 

input: its work with best in android auto but some time it doesnt read memory card in android auto and without android auto my phone is samsung j7 nxt with oreo version and second problem is its contain high amout of storage please fix it : 

input: simply great some videos downloaded in my phone were playing without audio in all of the otjer media olayers but it worked in this : 

input: the double tap to fast forward rewind is extremely buggy right now and the subtitles menu is fully broken fix these 2 to get a better rating : 

input: good play back but it would be nice if the ui allowed for more playlist creationorganization its great tibhave something that works with my linux os though : 

input: been my go to media player for so many years nothings going to change that if theres a file other apps cant open you can be sure that vlc will : 

input: damn great app but unusable the volume is way too low for listening with external speakers and yes i went in settings and boosted volume : 

input: used to be a great player now it always returns to start of file when resuming and you cant forward to a location someone broke this app badly : 

input: everything is okay except one problem there is no option so that we could see video list in gride view : 

input: good for the first video i had downloaded stopped displaying any moving pictures after i increased the speed : 

input: due the last update it confuse some time that which video i have to open because it show same thumbnail to every video before and after refresh pls solve it : 

input: i dont know why i have been using vlc on my pc never had problem but now on my phone it changes names of movies to evo and cmrm dont know why so it means when i want to check a movie i must first go to my gallery rather than going to vlc once : 

input: subtitles getting cropped when zoomed to fit screen although mx is filled with ads i still cant switch from it bcz of this issue : 

input: no resume playback position and orange theme is ugly should have these options to change and enable missing basic features is inexcusable : 

input: audio stops playing randomly during a song didnt do this before now its basically unusable : 

input: pretty good overall my only real problem is that the player refuses to acknowledge the subtitle files on my device : 

input: why is this a app for android how can you play disc on android they never made one yet s8 unable to used it no disc tray why did you made it for android no disc phone unless you make android with disc reader : 

input: my go to app for years however i suddenty have been a havimg an issue where currently playing doesnt show up on lock screen or the scroll down tab please fix this : 

input: user this to cast videos on to tv its very buggy and rarely shows the cast button when other apps show it always please fix : 

input: because of when r u playing the vedios or audios in ur mobile it losses its sound clarify : 

input: every thing is good but settings are so complicated and the play forward is morebut i think that there should play forward 2 to 3 seconds : 

input: once top now flop the last update broke something now everytime it comes to the end of the video it loops the last 5sec over and over again thats quite annoying  : 

input: new ui design is absolute trash kindly revert back to the old one and hire developers who actually know the difference between good and bad ui design : 

input: new update keeps crashing the app whenever i try to download subtitles and new ui made the app buffer : 

input: i dont like the upgraded one i cant download the subtitle anymore :

input: constantly crashing and having to restart : 

input: the two stars went missing as the app doesnt support torrents : 

input: d app is good for playg musicvideo but i wish it can merge musicvideo n it can also store them somewhere else in history : 

input: after watching some of my movies were converted to jpeg : 

input: i have used it for a few years not i tried other apps with pretty skins and stuff but always come back to vlc its the best player i have used its smple safe and no ads : 

input: overall its a good app but when i trying to cast it with chromecast its not showing subtitles : 

input: great app but i have trouble if i delete a movie from my phone it still appears in the vlc menu and i cant delete it otherwise excellent app : 

input: everything is fine but its not displaying subtitles while casting on chromecast thats the only issue that i am facing : 

input: this is the worse update ever you cant even refresh therefore you dont see new content and you see all historical content even those that are deleted which cannot be played this has gone from the best player to the worse : 

input: i like it bc there is no file which cant be played unless its not a media good job : 

input: the program totally is excellent but after updated it isnt working well specially when im working between programes and it will be in back side usually stop : 

input: i cant download subtitles resets my tab and i still cant download any subtitles shame does not even deserve my 1 star upgraded pweee shame :

input: good job all audio formats work but slow motion 1080p 240fps is again not working  : 

input: for some reason the app doesnt show the casting button any more and yes it is a problem with the app cause every other app is letting me cast to my tv : 

input: alright now everyone looking for another alternative to vlc unril the new good update is dine there is an app called musicolet works similarly i dont know about casting but absolutely no ads and good quality app id recommend that app : 

input: let us play 4k hevc cause its lagging but not on other players after the update when you add one song to your phone does vlc have to search at all my music just to find that one song i added before update this was done nore efficient i : 

input: the problems that solved in this version is not really solved when i used to see mkv format series of clip it suddenly ended up in midway i cant seek the video properly : 

input: great app only issue is when casting to chromecast the volume control doesnt work : 

input: good but the 201415 type was simple and organized than this one u touch one music and can play all but in this one u must play to play all : 

input: perfect except if you delete a video using vlc it reappears in vlc 80 of the time and wont go away even if the file is off your phone and youll have to redownload the app to get rid of them : 

input: please give an option to search of the subtitles that download subtitles button is almost useless :

input: keeps crashing while casting a video after three to four minutes it shows a message saying it connote play the file : 

input: i only use this app coz it supports only one audio format that mx player doesnt this app is rather alow and annoying at time mx player is the best  : 

input: if your default android media player doesnt allow speed adjustments and continuing where you left off this is the app to replace it : 

input: player is excellent equalizer is a plus despite all this the controls do not work from lock screen notification panelso for that : 

input: used to be my go to video player but since last updated this no longer allows me to cast direct to chromecast so no longer of any use to me : 

input: very good but doesnt have forward and backward buttons  :

input: chromecast situation is so poor so unlike this company who have always been so reliable still getting constant blue logo crashes almost instantly after casting : 

input: no color change for the name of the last viewed and visited path or file like in mx playerin mx player the name of the last visited folder and file will be in blue color : 

input: chromecast stops receiving cast from vlc google home chromecast device settings let others control your cast media off this should fix the problem : 

input: giant bug when pip picture in picture mode is enabled the video doesnt play in lock screen :

input: seems totally impossible to play all songs confusing menus not very user friendly at all : 

input: after the last update it has really started playing weirdly gets the whole phone hanged after playing just 6 minutes : 

input: i liked vlc alot but from last month it keeps pausing or stopping any audio i play it self even if phone is on desk and nothing touching it :

input: its gone from being the best media player to unusable songs just stop playing constantly : 

input: lots of bugs has to be fixed asap deleted items still shows in the list and no thumbnails is displayed of the videos : 

input: this aplication is amazing becsuse its the only app i know that can play iso files and also you can do live tv on this wich makes it even more amazingi dont like it i love it : 

input: silly omissions such as it not being possible to rearrange tracks in a playlist good otherwise : 

input: mp3 4 works awesome only there is a glitch when it cut off a part but who am i to complain cuz i didnt take the time to do this so  : 

input: is one of the best app as a video player the only scope for improvement left is the addition of hw and sw recorders like in the mx player : 

input: still the best always has been as long as lve been using them if vlc cant play it not much can : 

input: my only problem is play ts video format i cant fast forward that video using my android tv : 

input: its disappointing to mention that the subtitles are running faster by itself kindly fix this : 

input: nice app but it have some more speed than 4x that is like in vlc for pc which is upto 64 but in android it is should be 20xtimes for fast revision by running pictures : 

input: adding subtitle is not working also i cant go backwards : 

input: when i play through playlist the audiosubtitle and playback control and jump to time options doesnt work please fix this bug : 

input: not good stop doing background stuff everytime pictures or videos and games are on always background useage wasteing battery 2 stars : 

input: i thought the media library update will be fixed but it still cant find the other videos on my sd card : 

input: could you add immersive mode and sound equalizer and when im in use play buttons control bar is disappeared honestly interface is s but anything else gonna be nothing better : 

input: its great but it would be 5 5 if the widget would show the song data instead of nothing while playing : 

input: turkish subtitles are not shown correctly it changes some words to something else so it makes the subtitles unreadable and a nonsense : 

input: if file name has east asian characters their subtitle cannot be properly displayed eg xx xxmp4 with xx xx1srt xx xx2srt in the same folder vlc will displays them as track 1 2 but the xx xxsrt not even exist : 

input: yeah this app is great and all but it doesnt have the basic file share between apps capability for reasons unknown : 

input: the bug article was a fake vlc is safe ive been using it since the very beginning great app : 

input: these updates has so many bugs the lock doesnt work as expected anymore the video options button doesnt respond most times : 

input: only app that lets you chromecast offline files to mi tv 4c proall other apps failed to do so its a life saver appkudos to the developers : 

input: i had a small problem with the app gave feedback and the problem was resolved the next day : 

input: the ab repeat mode is totally nonintuitive impossible to figure out although maybe it just doesnt work : 

input: are there compatibility issues on android 10 because i cant see any seek buttons for skipping forward or back 10 seconds choosing to display the buttons under settings does nothing : 

input: why does the same song play from my music files whenever i switch bluetooth on i dont use vlc for audio and it just starts playing on its own agggrrrr : 

input: app is so good for every thing for voice and vedio buy one thing i want in this app that was to arrange songs in playlist i am not able to arrange them in play list :

input: the best thing about vlc player is that it has its own inbuilt codecs which plays every damn video formats : 

input: too many bugs it hangs and stops playing videos if even paused for a minute :

input: the video was fine at first but now its always cutting it makes me irritated : 

input: audio just freezes from time to time please resolve this : 

input: was one of my most used and fav apps but what all have you done in the latest update it is completely buggy now : 

input: takes forever to scan and parse media not worth it :

input: will play any video format even incomplete downloads android version lacks tools the windows version has : 

input: very poor app it started deleting everything on my storage card to make room for its own files only it bypasses all permissions : 

input: would be 5 stars but there is no reason for the widget to use up cpu resources when i have no widgets in use or placed anywhere at all : 

input: play list and repeat options arent available it seems : 

input: awesome but when isnt it i use it on windows 10 and on here been using it for years and will continue to do so :

input: when i trying to play a song the song is stopping in a fraction of second : 

input: it supports all types of format have no ads i likr this because it can play m3u8 and xapf playlist easily that is not supported by mx player and 360 degree video also supports so this is the video app i ever seen : 

input: i love vlc the only feature missing in the android app is the share link to messenger or email :

input: every time i open vlc it says i have no media but when i file explore theyre all there app and android are current : 

input: i love vlc but for some reason the subtitles keep unloading themselves since i mostly watch subbed anime thats annoying : 

input: has problems interacting with android memory but as a media player its functionality is excellent :

input: media folder is not showing files correctly due to cache memory and sometimes it cant be possible to delete files if its wanted : 

input: why now theres no close button on the notification area and the notification areas play pause button now has a lag : 

input: clutter free simple no ads basically the best : 

input: it was used to be 5 stars but for some reason the media library prefrences doesnt change no matter how much i click on the damn thing so basically vlc is useless at that point :
