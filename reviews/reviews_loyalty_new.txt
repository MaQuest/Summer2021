input: so far so good thank you so much and keep up with the good work i really love this app please dont change this app please  : 

input: it looks like a good start but i dont get whats so awesome about it currently useless without front back photo snapshots plus a way to export backup would be excellent though very few cards apps ive seen has this feature so im not knocking this project for lack of it : 

input: barcode scanner is not working : 

input: this doesnt work at self serve checkouts you need to fix this problem : 

input: the barcode scanner st cbs wouldnt recognize or was unable to scan the barcode displayed by this app therefore its useless : 

input: i had to get a new app after my previous one wouldnt work after my phone upgrade downloaded three different apps of this type and this was the easy winner simple interface easy to upload all my cards and nothing fancy a few cards added a number or letter at the end easily edited and it was weird having to select the style of scanning code makes me nervous if i did it right so well see how it works in practice : 

input: installed and having a problem with a scanned card i tried today to use my phone instead of the card and it wouldnt scan properly we proceeded entering the numbers manually and realized that a one was added to the card number needs to be fixed update it seems it was only the air miles card as all the other cards are okay manually corrected the air miles card with me bar code thanks devs for a good app with no ads and respect for privacy : 

input: exactly what i needed after google pay made it harder and harder to save loyalty cards for small businesses like my local gym thank you : 

input: i havent had to carry a wallet since installing this excelent app brilliant clean simple interface tiny memory footprint between only 12 30 that of the higher rated competition free would have given 5 stars if it would facilitate customisation of list order displays cards in alphabetical order only i will contact the dev with this suggestion happily upgrade rating to 5 stars should they impliment it : 

input: numbers only i have annual membership passes that have my picture on it the barcode is not enough to get into the zoo aquarium please consider adding the ability to add images front and back i would love to ditch the cards : 

input: never had any issues with this appi dont use it much because i prefer the feel of real cards but its saved me a few times when ive forgotten my wallet update i also use it to access websitesbusinesses that use qr codes : 

input: fine performer just one problem there is no way to transfer the data to a new phone and it doesnt look like theres any way to get support otherwise i would give this app five stars : 

input: awesome simple and to the point i wish it could remember when i click on the blockunblock rotation button instead of clicking everytime i open the card : 

input: good job just a tiny detail card note font size doesnt seem to work and note looks halfhidden until you tap it but its irrelevant great app : 

input: does what it says well no ads small size developers react blazingly fast you can share or backup your cards via files best i managed to find : 

input: perfect no ads its fast and doesnt have you standing in line waiting for the info to pull up to give to the cashier like stocard did nice job : 

input: perfect lightweight no ads open source what else could you ask for : 

input: this app does what it says with no frills it replaced similar app that took a long time to open and had features i didnt use : 

input: just missing an option to keep screen on awake : 

input: made my purse and handbag much lighter thanks : 

input: can i delete previosly saved cards : 

input: need sorting amd search        : 

input: it works small foot print straight to the point no ads it is missing two features that i would like 1 to set the icon of a card to an image either photo or file and 2 when the phone is rotated 90 degrees to only show the barcode this for difficult readers but i still gave 5 stars because of the small foot print and no ads : 

input: simple and quick to use stored all my cards in 10 mins : 

input: very useful app unfortunately the fixed product scanners with the glass window on the table cant seem to read barcodes on oled displays but thats not the apps fault hand scanners do work but not all stores have them in my case thats edeka : 

input: compact simple does the job and doesnt even try to be more than it is no ads no unneeded permissions no bs perfection : 

input: barcord not scanning           : 

input: no invasive permissions simple perfect : 

input: great app fully doing what promised no ads no weird permissions : 

input: does exactly what it needs to i make heavy use of it feature you could add the widget icons dont conform to my icon pack and cant be changed ummm i cant think of anything else how refreshing would that be an app that does everything you need and then its done : 

input: doesnt work at all             : 

input: brilliant app no need to create an account no hastle just name optional note then scan or enter number manually love it small suggestion would be to allow us to select a card logo or colour maybe a colour selector when creating a card that changes a highlight colour in the list andor the background colour when displaying the barcode also my ikea family card is 20odd digits long but the barcode image ends up quite crushed from the sides and rotating it to landscape does not stretch it meaning its hard to get the reader to read it : 

input: it works would be nice to keep scan of cards like beep n go and backup to google drivebut otherwise good : 

input: i see nothing what happen can you help me out here i missed something the barcode doesnt show up when i click on the app its asking me to start again : 

input: unable to change the card number and unable to remove a store : 

input: great app so far just a question whats that lock icon on the top right : 

input: simple and small app so great in those regards one question when adding a widget the text is black which is hard to see against my dark wallpaper text on all my other apps is white can that be fixed : 

input: no ads data usage or laundry list of permissions trying to collect data from all my social media accounts only want it to do 1 thing and thats what it does well : 

input: widget text color is wrong nice simple app otherwise but the widget doesnt stick to the standard android font of white text with a black outline the text is all black so barely readable to be able to tell which card is which : 

input: looks ok unable to import png image of card generic error message with no clues as to how to troubleshootresolve : 

input: app not able to save the cards that are photographed hence app uninstalled pronto : 

input: i was able to scan this at one store but it didnt work at the next store i visited where a previous app had no problem : 

input: needs a feature to take pictures of the frontback of the cards needs the ability to use google drive directly and store a cached copy in case the network is unavailable : 

input: difficult to use               :
