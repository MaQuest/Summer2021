input: this app was great for a little over a month then it suddenly stopped letting me log in all i ever get is authentication failed please reenter credentials i guess ill just log in through the internet as that works fine i tried deleting the app data and uninstalling reinstalling but the error persists if it werent for that error i would love the app but it is completely useless if i cant log in : 

input: good app the map is a really nice feature however it should be possible to cache the hosts on the map once loaded internet is not always goodavailable and it would decrease the load on your servers check how ioverlander does it : 

input: dont want to be overly critical of warmshowers as they do an incredible job but just like everybody else i cant log in any more works fine in a web browser but not in the app will update review when this gets fixed : 

input: suddenly began experiencing same login problems others have authentication failed but prior to this i loved the app i find it much easier than the mobile version of the website to search for hosts etc hoping it will be fixed soon :

input: i cant log in with the app although i can do i it at the warmshowers website using the same login details it makes the app pretty much unusable for now : 

input: does not work at all would give 0 stars no help from app creator to solve issue will not connect to internet even though i can connect on laptop with website : 

input: app is useless cannot log in using checked and double checked credentials very basic stuff and very poor form for an organisation that solicits donations : 

input: the app js totally unusable as it doesnt let me log in reading the previous reviews its clearly an old issue and i cant understand why nobody bpthers to correct it : 

input: had to uninstall the app now reinstalled i cannot login i get the message communication with server failed please check internet connection there is nothing wrong with my connection : 

input: app has vastly improved with the last update however with newly integrated openstreet maps it loads reaally slowly to the point its just barely usable so it really needs to be improved : 

input: it doesnt work check internet connection is the only message that i get : 

input: serious flaws the flag is at my old address but when the listing is displayed the new address is given problem is its 11 km away with a bike in a hilly area that is a lot :

input: does not seem to be working    : 

input: wont let me log in             : 

input: great network of great people and the app is pretty good however there are a few features i would love to see 1 autosaved drafts for messages its infuriating to lose everything youve typed because you went back to look again at the map or someones profile 2 add a location search bar to the map view so i can zoom to a city and then browse people on the map 3 overlay a gpx file so i can see how far off my planned route a host might be 4 switch to something like a custom mapbox vector map optimized for cycling : 

input: edit may2019 cant login the app authentication failed while the web version works the app needs a fast connection when i am under 20 kbs the app fails to load the map even when it succeeds it wrongly says there are no hosts around this app generally uses a lot of data when available as an other option loading the website in a mobile browser make my data usage skyrocket as well this is very inconvenient because this should be useful especially when travelling abroad : 

input: hey guys i cant send messages through the app : 

input: i reinstall app and i cant login again dose not working how can i login by my warmshowers account i love you and all cyclists : 

input: this is not even a simple copy of the website it is rather a very limited version of it you cant even read new messages in there but youll get redirected to their website which has one of the worst mobile layouts ive ever come across beta version would probably the best term to describe this app this is a shame because the concept itself is really nice : 

input: connection issues every single time on galaxy s7 i have not been able to use the app at all please fix im running 151 : 

input: not much help when i cant even read my messages with it : 

input: i am currently cycling through the americas i save hosts as favourites then when i access offline it can take up to 23 minutes to find the information that it should have saved previously online it frequently tells me there is no internet access despite being in a strong location very slow and frustrating to use what could potentially be a very good app : 

input: guys im on my journey around the us had been using the app for a month but then it started acting like no connection to the server i love ur project and all but what use i have of the app and he project now when i cant connect to the server this sucks now every night i gotta sleep in my tent which wuz eaten through by nasty ants no showers especially warm ones : 

input: since the majority of activity that someone participating on warmshowers does is reading and responding to messages its a huge gap to not be able to read things directly the app makes its usefulness extremely limited in my opinion on top of that for my phone there is currently a bug that freezes the app when checking for messages : 

input: its sad to see the same issue now as one year ago i could not even login due to failed connection with server as a travellers app its totally useless sorry guys  : 

input: problems with the notice of the message arrives constantly checking the site and pray to god that the request was read missing wifi free call : 

input: the map never loaded when i needed out on tour should be like the allstays app with info available without data as long as youve looked at that area before : 

input: day 3 app took my login but wouldnt load user profiles day 4 it loaded profiles but wouldnt send messages finally yesterday it began functioning without any problems now that its working correctly ive come to like the way the app functions : 

input: doesnt show any hosts on the map keeps saying failure due to not having an internet connection i have an internet connection i tried uninstalling the app and reinstalling but its he same story completely useless app : 

input: when it tries to connect internet it shows error message telling about problem with internet connection the only thing it can do download map it shows error too but the map is downloaded using it over 3g connection : 

input: many issues listed by others over the last year have not been fixed : 

input: as title long loading the switch to other app then back crash : 

input: improvements needed and many features shud be added to the app this is somehow disappointing : 

input: very bad impossible to use it always connection problem : 

input: failed connection with server everytime i load map : 

input: this app is trash not ableto log in : 

input: thanks to warmshowernow i just can have friend from all around the worldi already hosting 4 person now : 

input: i did a search for a member by entering the town of her address and this app found no results there are 3 members with this town address when i use my desktop computer i need to be able to search by town : 

input: have been using this very useful app on my cross canada trek cant stand messaging limits which make it so difficult to keep track of conversations with hosts when i send a message i ask that hosts reply via email so i can keep track i naturally mix up names all the time which is why i find the limits so frustrating fix this and i will worship you like a god : 

input: i love warm showers but this app is wicked frustrating i have had to uninstall and reinstall it three times because it froze up and i couldnt do anything with it so i lose my starred hosts and have to set up the app again : 

input: supposedly this bug was fixed unfortunately this app doesnt work and im heading out next week for a coast to coast bike trip : 

input: same opinion as sonya app keeps shutting down and does not log in or search properly : 

input: needs registration to use      : 

input: cant log in after the update   : 

input: when i go to message someone a box comes up saying message sent successfully yet the message does not get sent in reality because none of the people have received it so at the moment the app is kind of useless its only good for locating hosts : 

input: well im traveling by bike with a tablet and this app is a must for actually using the site overall everything works great maps profiles offline storage however like others have noted it does sometimes say that it could not send due to internet credentials and it only seems to happen with certain encrypted wifi connections hopefully this will be fixed in the future because the app is sleek otherwise : 

input: been having new people stay over on random nights for years : 

input: it always needed a very good connection to load host data which makes it useless when you need it most on the road no it stopped loading hosts data altogether even with my fast wifi connection at home : 

input: i cannot log into this app on phone when i try i then cant enter on website i phoned and though he tried to help nothing worked useless if it wont allow login : 

input: would be great to incorporate all warmshowers functions to app really an issue that there is no message function :
