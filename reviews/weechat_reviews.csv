5,"easiest way to connect relay to my weechat irc client on my linuxbsd server working great so far on android pie it still lacks of input insert commands so i cannot use input colors there too apart from that its working great better than any paidfree android standalone irc client :  
"
6,"fantastic app when it does work but clearly doesnt like nougat has not been successfully connecting since then dev hit me up for details no bug report option in the app as far as i can tell forced to use glowing bear at the moment and this app is definitely superior to it :  
"
7,"had some crashing issues at first but now it works like a charm the only thing missing is loading earlier messages like in glowing bear also it loses the scroll position when focus is lost :  
"
8,"installed weechat into an archlinuxarm chroot rsyncd my config files from my desktop ran it in a term and connected to localhost in the app 10 10 my only gripe is that it doesnt like my physical tab key :  
"
9,"nothing changed in the serverside config and i reentered everything in the client it fails with wrong password even though theres no password on the server :  
"
10,"broke with nougat cant connect at all no configuration changes in app nor on my server reach out of you need more information :  
"
11,"does everything you would expect and moreif you already know what to expect from a weechat relay client dont forget to dig in the options for settings like connect on launch and tab button for nick competition :  
"
12,"cant change buffers without minimising the keyboard :  
"
13,"i re installed the app after having my phone reset to factory settings i loaded the current version but a problem wont let me get past the settings page :  
"

"
15,"a great relay for weechat updates only make it better no serious bugs ive found :  
"
16,"i have weechat running on a server this app on the phone its the perfect combination i used a ssh client screen before which was ok but this works much better thx :

"
25,"uma                            :  
"
26,"this app is absolutely fantastic i was worried it might chew up a lot of battery being in the background all of the time but that is absolutely not the case very very light on battery usage there are a few small quirks like a limited buffer size i think it might only be 500 lines and is a fixed number :  
"
27,"but it is true it really works not sure if joining a channel is not yet supported or if ive been looking in the wrong places but thats no big deal :  
"
28,"the menu button doesnt work on android 51 so the app cannot be used in its present state when you click the button nothing happens the menu doesnt open or anything at all this is on my nexus 7 2012 running stock android 51 :  
"
29,"crashes whenever someone highlights me though it appears to be caused by highlight alert sound :  
"
30,"i couldnt try it yet because i need socks5 proxy support feature request :  
"
31,"network connectivity doesnt crash anymore yay :  
"
32,"this is exactly to my taste a lot of good design choices here and its very comfortable to use its also free as in freedom which is a huge bonus i disagree with other commenters stating its not much better than using an ssh client i think the android client is a much nicer experience myself but good things aside as its still in beta with a few prominent bugs it would be silly to give it 5 stars then what would i give it whenif it reaches a more robust state two of the bugs ive noticed so far is that is seems to randomly crash a lot and that colors in prefixes do not match my weechatconf while the text does i really hope this great app will get further development :  
"
33,"great app to use i am just missing the option to get notified when i recieve a highlight or pm there is a play sound option but it is not working would love a traditional notification textmessage style :  
"
34,"i opened the app and did not see any preferences option in the menu just settings thinking i was missing something i also went through the readme at the projects github page but couldnt fund anything i am on htc one maybe this app doesnt work on htc phones :
