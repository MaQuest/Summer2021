0,"i like the app for the simplicity set up is easy and i was writing in minutes that said im disappointed that punctuation errorsespecially quotation marksare glitches in the app itself not the writer and arent corrected in published posts if theres spell check i cant find it :  
"
1,"wordpress was listed as the best blogging platform which is why i chose it for my business efforts instead of blogger which i was more familiar with its more intricate than blogger so more complicated but once you get the hang of it its awesome my jury is still out on the boxes tool :  
"
2,"its really buggy and it takes at least half a dozen tries to upload images i have to hit retry over and over so one simple post takes a stupid amount of time to upload its a necessary evil for my business and keeping a blog on my website current :  
"
3,"the application is cool i tried upgrading my free wordpress blog to premium plan but find it difficult to make payment even when i made use of paypal cant nigerians upgrade with paypal account because i dont have foriegn account or atm for transaction i have sent notifications to help support but no replies or response i might be forced to use another host and domain if i am unable to upgrade with wordpress kindly look into it thanks :  
"
4,"trying to start a new blog and its pretty frustrating my images wont upload my blog post i typed up wont upload and im just confused and feeling defeated not easy to use this app at all i may as well just create a new site from scratch :  
"
5,"its a great platform to write and publicize i still have to connect through facebook and my other social media sites its taking lot of time and still i am not connected :  
"
6,"tried the app a few years ago and it was pretty useless but the browser version had issues on my device recently so i thought id try the app again cant upload audio and a lot of other missing features i pay this company a lot of money and disappointed in this useless app :  
"
7,"this app is hanging soo much i wrote a blog for my college friends and wanted to attach photos but it iss sooo annoying that its jumbling everything exchanging the photos and sometimes repeating them all my efforts went in vain i am very very upset with this app :  
"
8,"this app is getting terrible day by day i try to star someones post and when i star it and refreshed it the star i gave has gone this happens every single time please do something before it ruins everyones blog :  
"
9,"while its a good to start my webpage and blog the word format blocks and picture resizing etc is confusing doesnt seem quick to adapt developer may want to improve to make it easier for novice :  
"
10,"ive been having issues with preview images not showing on social media like facebook and whatsapp whenever i share my blog post after viewing it doesnt work behave that way with web browser and also could you integrate the seo plugins to work directly from the mobile app that will really be useful :  
"
11,"im having trouble to making post on my site through mobile application im unable to upload photos in post especially feature photo drafted post not update on cloud whenever i try to upload drafted post on browser not available their :  
"
12,"this is the best app i have used so far my problem is that im struggling to upgrade my plan i have been trying to move from the free plan but i get errors all the time :  
"
13,"this not good and hard to understand its like using an ads page very confusing definitely there no user familiar ui is very bad :  
"
14,"it works and i like the features but recently i cannot see sheduled post from the site admin and the post feature in the app is not updating with my website the app tries to connect the drops and says retry :  
"
15,"last update broke the ability to paste text properly if you paste a list it shows up with all the words pressed together like a paragraph lame :  
"
16,"why can i not upload media this has been ongoing for nearly a month makes this app useless when im on the road sans laptop trying to post articles :  
"
17,"wordpress keeps stopping after the last update new since i am unable to open the app and there are no way i can access help support i send you my wordpress app screenshot via email :  
"
18,"the app is good for the bloggers ive started from wordpress too there is only one thing about which im not satisfied and its really annoying when the post gets too long the words start getting omitted on their own have to write again and again takes too much time the site starts hanging and very hard to start a new paragraph and lines plss fix this problem i really have to struggle a lot at this to write blogs :  
"
19,"the reason i did not give it 5 stars is because it takes time to load and customising the site is a bit complicated other than that its fun :  
"
20,"love this app to quickly edit my posts and add new blocks the one thing i havent been able to find is my portfolio to edit it :  
"
21,"so far the worst app ive ever used i have never used this app still it shows you already have the account it doesnt even changes the password and im not able to open the app :  
"
22,"in an effort to accommodate more people wordpress has gone from an easy comfortable format to a complicated irritating frustrating platform that makes it almost impossible to set up a consistent uniform look for every paragraph in every post you produce if its possible that process is so confusing that it demands constant adjustment :  
"
23,"i have installed this app today and it is giving login problem error reloading your gravatar whenever i tried to login through google it is showing checking and then coming to same login page and whenever i tried to login via email its not proceeding to next this app is very slow although verifying account via email it is showing couldnt retrieve your profile :  
"
24,"its a good app overall but its seriously buggy there are several issues with it such as not getting notified about things a majority of the time and refreshing the page just to view your updated post doesnt help at all because either it shows you the old version or it doesnt update at all the positive thing about this is that the stats and the editor are good please fix these issues because we all need it :  
"
25,"nice app but i have face some problem as soon as i share the blog the picture attached to the post is not showing in it :  
"
26,"loving this app my only complain is that when people comment in my post i cant click on the user names inside the app and get to their sites like i do in web reader  :  
"
27,"really great and helpful app ill recommend it for anyone i also love that it saves work automatically even if you phone shutsdown but sometimes it gets a little annoying when you type and are all ready to post then it publishes a previous version of your saved work and not the latest one but i really enjoy using it and navigating thank you for making my work easy i no write from the train the bus i dont have to carry a laptop around everytime :  
"
28,"i have worked very well with wordpress but since the last update the editor became complicated to use at the begining all the editor options were in the tool bar now you have to press several buttons to get the option you want the underline option is not even available anymore and if you press the enter button to pass to other linerow it lets a huge space between them about 3 normal rows please do something about that because in this condition i cant even use it anymore :  
"
29,"needs more updates wont let me take my photos with phone and put them directly on the blog just keeps saying unable to load so because of that i have to email my photos from my phone to my laptop every day its getting old fast and i think its total bull how im supposed to pay 100 just to have a small walk through on how to navigate the program should come with original purchase :  
"
30,"this app used to work really well until the most recent update now when im writing a new post it takes forever to catch up when whatever im writing runs on to another row so i have to carry on hope for the best and go back and edit any mistakes when its finally caught up its also almost impossible to start writing in a new block as the new block just doesnt appear its taking me twice as long to write anything now and is twice as difficult to use :  
"
31,"if i could i wouldnt even give this app one star the app barely works its a blessing if you get your work done with less than 20 glicthes the app freezes for no reason crashes frequently doesnt add images to the blog and is overall very laggy :  
"
32,"uploading multiple media files creates huge congestion at server side file upload runs into timeout and so fails when uploading on pc through wordpress site it does upload one file after the other here you send the eg 10 files together i sent an email but no feedback and it is definitely not sequential :  
"
33,"1 simple controls like adding a hyperlink to the text work erratically the popup to add url doesnt appear when it appears even if i save the url it doesnt reflect in the preview 2 editing post is not only slow switching between controls often doesnt work 3 while i havent digged into the details it runs slowly on my phonegalaxy s8 even when other apps are closed also the phone heats up :  
"
34,"wordpress has been my first choice for basic website needs i found it less than userfriendly at first but over time the site has improved past functionality was quirky and illogical when creating posts editing features took getting used to pages appearances are fine for basic website hosting ads are to be expected wirh this basic level of platform price is perhaps a bit overpriced for easeuse of website features overall website performance :  
"
35,"the wordpress app has always been pretty good the new editor whilst great in some respects will hinder me in particular as i post a lot of poetry it removes what little control i was able to have over the page form i challenge one of the app developers to try and type out any poem within the editor i did use the html editor instead but now that immediately implements things as hypertext please give me more freedom to arrange my text on the page italic bold malfunction sometimes too :  
"
36,"used word press for years and have built 4 websites with it whenever there is something i cannot do the online help is excellent they have frequently done things for me such as embed maps etc theres a lit of functionality i am still unable to access due to my general ineptitude but ill find a way the only annoying thing is that certain things are not available in the app just from a browser :  
"
37,"i just downloaded this app 2 nights ago i just went to open it and it wont open at all it keeps giving me an error saying it crashed and then when i try it again another error says it keeps crashing so i cant even use this app at all im actually really disappointed im going to have to delete this and go with blogger tumblr or another blogging app to start my blog now i have a revvl plus made by coolpad exclusively for tmobile i got it at the end of may 2018 :  
"
38,"very frustrating wanted to start by organizing menu items because an apple user showed me how easy it was android app i find out has no option in the app after meeting with the other user we find out i have to go to independent publisher 2 and get redirected to the browser there we find menu but am unable to open the items i create unable to delete items because tapping on the arrow drop down button on the right only works 11000 times not user friendly disappointing app experienc :  
"
39,"i love using wordpress the features have gotten easier to use over the past year and there is a lot of interaction with other users making it a kind of social media platform that being said i still have some problems getting certain things to work because the optional integrations are made by other companies and sometimes they dont work well or are not intuitive i still cant get it to post to my facebook page and that is why i am giving it four stars instead of five :  
"
40,"block editor is very slow to load and its a nightmare for text created elsewhere list block turns into text block after pasting lines of text and it cant be changed or adjusted underscore text option is missing app lags when adding blocks formatting in classic editor is now wonky especially for lists :  
"
41,"update4820 still some latency in publishing and cannot seem to erase old and long gone websites other than the hide function but most functionality issues fixed bravo old 1 crashes all the time and i cannot post to my sites 2 blanks out after spending lot of time writing a post in it then loosing all of my work because it blanks out when i hit publish and it hasnt saved 3 the worpress admin panel is bad to utilize most importantly you loose the user functionality :  
"
42,"it has been a life saver to be able to maintain my site remotely i just dont get much time with my home computer these days :  
"
43,"im so angry i cant load my pages and posts pages couldnt be refreshed at this time i cant update or install plugins too its all so annoying update i sent a mail to your team a couple of days before posting my review they havent responded :  
"
44,"its a very nice appi have been using it past 8 monthsbut from last few weeksthere is a problemits not pinging me any comment notification instead i have to go n check those particularl blogs and while uploading any postthe comment section goes missing sometimes because of which i have to delete that particular post and repost please fix this soon :  
"
45,"i am not able to include my wordpess website link in instagram or facebook and why is that so :  
"
46,"hey folks its been a very pleasant experience since joining wordpress but for sometime now its becoming a bit of a headache most especially using the wordpress app using the apps comes with so much ease since i blog on the move but lately ive been forced to publish via my browser any time i publish through the app i get 1 upload failed saved to drafts im not sure what it is but i can use some assistance here thats if it isnt a general issue :  
"
47,"i really love this i use my wordpress self hosted domain here but each time i try to publish a post it will tell the post has not been published meanwhile its already published but keep uploading same post over and over again :  
"
48,"the app is too goodbut when we edit a postthe link gets changed too i request that the edited post should not have another linkit creates lots of problemsbecause we cant justify when someone reaches with the old link :  
"
49,"this is a great app i love it but i was doing a blog post on my phone yesterday i saved it thinking it was saved on the blog but when i got on my laptop and opened the blog post the stuff i put on it was not there this is the first time that this ever happened to me it saved on my phone on the app how do i get it on my laptop again :  
"
50,"app could be more intuitive it seems a bit clunky but ive only been at it a few weeks :  
"
51,"pretty good though you need another app downloaded to wordpress for it to work jetpack only issue i have is that i am unable to put web links in the content unless theyre an email address would be a nice improvement :  
"
52,"i am totally disappointed wordpress is not free as claimed you cant edit html and many more blogger is still the best you have to pay before you can enjoy these features with wordpress :  
"
53,"i can use it but there are too many places where the default and classic mode arent compatible its difficult to start a new paragraph after an image in classic mode :  
"
54,"on tablet this app is not very useful doesnt support tables and the preview function often doesnt work its better to just use the web admin from browser :  
"
55,"my experience with this application is quite good but im quite unsatisfied also with this application as people who are known to me all are saying that its difficult for them to like comment share and follow my account :  
"
56,"overall its not bad but the process to make a post is incredibly awful i tend to write a longpost for my blog and because of that sometimes the app is crashingstop working this just make me uncomfortable writing or even posting on this app id rather back to pc version :  
"
57,"i cant update my site via this app it keeps stopping and failing :  
"
58,"hi i am unable to log in it it always shows some errors please rectify it :  
"
59,"great idea but keeps crashing when you nearly finish a post some times :  
"
60,"ive been looking for online platforms to publiah my articles i didnt know wordpress was there for me :  
"
61,"this app was great till i received an update 2 days back i am unable to publish my article as it goes to scheduled even after i click publish now nothing happens :  
"
62,"you cant add buttons to the menu button and you cant even box up your blog posts like wix blogs are categorized your paragraphs just look like a never ending list of words instead of a short box that you can separate them from other blog postssoooo frustrating and irritating :  
"
63,"same as the website so no complaints there however thats where the positives end i have had issues with publishing my blog posts instantly they keep scheduling my post even though i set it to publish instantly which is frustrating and unreliable for instant publication sticking to blog posting on the web :  
"
64,"it used to be smoother but the updated version seems to freeze and typed words dont appear for a a few seconds after youve typed them almost like its trying to catch up with itself :  
"
65,"the fact that wordpress provides the rare opportunity for writting and publishing cannot be overemphasized but the problem is that it keeps on stopping telling me to either close or wait so please do something to fix this :  
"
66,"experience has been okay overall but not this evening i cannot log in to my blog via laptop the push notification from the app is not going through to the website whatever was changed please change it back thanks :  
"
67,"excellent app for monitoring your wordpress site havent used it to build posts only problem has been uploading media in batches often fails to upload all photos in the batch otherwise good app :  
"
68,"i cant connect my social accounts twitter facebook at the last step the app shows a message error occured one suggestion it would be very useful to have a multi delete function in media tab instead of deleting medias one by one :  
"
69,"we need to be able to upload files from this app like musics and other document files right now its only photos and videos which arent enough and also we need to be able to search for categories when we want to post just give us a search bar there :  
"
70,"good im a complete novice but with a one day training course and some messing around i am getting a website out there i upgraded and have the domain name not happy though that i cannot download mp4 as it wants me to upgrade again :  
"
71,"well good but i cant figure out how to type on the introduction page just let us go at things and give us options and advice as we type along you can give us new ideas then too but we just want to type our thoughts imediately :  
"
72,"very glitchy and slow does not show all the options available while editing the only good feature about it is the stats section and likewise didnt expect such below average app from such a rich and prosperous developer :  
"
73,"very very poor its always been slow uncomfortable and full of bugs this was the case when i used it the first timeand same is the case nownever using this app again :  
"
74,"the stats dont update todsy may 13 the still show stats for may 11 even though i keep refreshing i have to restart my phone if i want updated stats :  
"
75,"the app worked a few times and now i cant upload feature images im trying to reinstall for the second time hoping it will work fine :  
"
76,"very easy to use the only thing is i am having trouble adding content and media to my site and it keeps saying couldnt refresh at this time and it sometimes crashes :  
"
77,"what are usually do is that i upload photos from my gallery on android in recent months this doesnt work any more failure to upload all the time the app has become unusable for me :  
"
78,"must include search bar to search elements or words within a webpage search bar at present shows all the pages to customers and that is not fair hope wordpress will fix it :  
"
79,"wasting time this is the wrost creation by wordpress because it doesnt run even in full internet access and many a times it doesnt not accept photos to be uploaded in it :  
"
80,"im new to this so i may not be fair but i feel navigating around this is kinda confusing also once i approve of a commenti really dont know if its approved and keep clicking it again only to be told that it seems like im duplicating it :  
"
81,"every time this updates something changes so that my readers disappear and views are less i cannot seem to keep up very disappointed :  
"
82,"i am unable toupload any type of media files on the blog post o dont know why its happening but this should be repaired :  
"
83,"before its good now not login my web idmissing xmlrpc method showing now very poor apps :  
"
84,"loving for now only one problem sometimes it automatically insert codes while using html editor and block editor simultaneously thats annoying :  
"
85,"composing and editing blog posts on my phone with this app is a disaster this app is a hot mess for writers i have no idea where to even begin :  
"
86,"app came highly recommeded for mobile use it wpuld seem almost perfect except the app doesnt allow you to log in using username it asks for email address how can this be a different process to the normal website  :  
"
87,"pretty useless when i click on the notification that i have a comment to approve it brings me to a sign in screen where i enter my email address then nothing happens :  
"
88,"i find wordpress is slow on my pc and on ios :

"
164,"the wordpress app when it works is lovely but it rarely works so many bugs and hiccups and just falls flat whenever you try and do a task and nothing is worse when youre trying to make a mobile post through the app and the post just fails and forever loops not posting the article instead just reminding you over and over how an error has occurred :

171,"featured image uploading problem :  
"
172,"using it for a year or so nice best used for creating simple blog postspages with a pic or two and general management of site insights and reader are a fabulous tools designed to inform site managers of online traffic and also simplify site aesthetics for those who browse there are limitations on wp postpage design and the app doesnt support buildingediting podcast pages at all :  
"
173,"earlier it was fantastically fantastic but now its lagging and getting freezed at every stage whenever i try to update and compose my story its becoming so slow that im unable to type a story and it hangs or freezes so much that even if i press backspace or try to exit it doesnt process well all other sites and platforms are working except this im unable to type and frame my story at all it hangs freezes and irritates me :  
"
174,"i ve been happy for years with this app but lately when i push publish now it tells me scheduled i have no control about when i want to publish sometimes it gets published within 24 hrs sometimes doesnt get published at all this is bad meanwhile staff got in contact with me and helped me fix the problem above thanks a lot i just had another issue lately uploading pictures it seems i could not upload as many as i wanted between 5 and 10i had this the two last posts i sent :  
"
175,"my english teachers often lowered my grades for largely mechanical errors also wordy was frequently a snarky margin comment nobody had much interest in the content but a runon sentence fragment or omg no end punctuation instant f on wordpress a lot of these vexing problems are addressed on autopilot and a writer can be as wordy as they want even if their subjects and verbs argue and never agree authors wait for a block of time and inspiration writers write everyday :  
"
176,"confused app sometimes it misbehaves you might include an image on the work then it doesnt feature in the link hope the update will have fixed that :  
"
177,"the app is nearly unuseable i write and inputs take ages to apply then the app sometimes crashes and i tell it to wait it out it usually catches up but nearly a minute later horrible experience i guess im sticking with my web browser or perhaps finding a third party app if any exist :  
"
178,"nothing works anymore posts dont update stats even the apparent external website fails to be recognised this used to be a much better app for being able to blog its now useless and cant be used you have to use desktop for everything to work the way you want it to disappointing :  
"

"
180,"overall the functionality seems good however theres no sharing section in the android app like in ios i have to go to mobile web to update thats kind of pointless i dont want to write in to development inside the app forward this to them geez thats not what im talking about and its not in the app not sharing posting it twitter linkedin with checkbox and default if title look at apple app this option isnt available i cant give you screenshot because its only on ios  :  
"
181,"great free app for someone who just wants to solidify certain events in their life i havent paid for it since i am a bit broke at the moment fulltime student and a veteran but if and when i am able to i may buy it on the other hand why would i buy it i am not promoting anything just writing my thoughts down :  
"
182,"very poor useless application wanted to quickly start local blog about photography walking local history and anything welsh application so far has been an ergonomic disaster area upload photo dissappears publish blog and says it is private confusing pages of useless information things need to be sensible simple and actually work looking now for alternative option without having to resort to diy html alternative albeit think that option even with ftp etc will in long term be simplier :  
"
183,"im not sure if i understand how this operates but i own a domain name and have a hosting for a website i had thought i could use wp to design and publish now all i am informed when i type in my website is that it is not on wp its all confusing especially on mobile is there something i dont know about :  
"
184,"everything you need to do at your fingertips instantly just by working on the app the android version doesnt allow you to do everything from the app but it does give you the admin option to design and customize from the desktop on through your chrome browser i would definitely recommend wordpress :  
"
185,"on android app widgets dont work if you wanted to see stats of visit :  
"
186,"as i have a wordpress blog i have to use this app it goes black it freezes up for as long as 30 minutes i have to install it and reinstall it again updated 2222020 the only way this app works well is to uninstall then install it again on a regular basis :  
"
187,"this latest version no longer lets me share an article from a web browser into a new post it always gives me a blank post where before it set the post title to the article title and placed a link to the article in the body of the post this app is pretty useless to me until its fixed :  
"
188,"i enjoy using this app and wordpress itself as the online computer version regarding the app i am missing the option to post several pictures as a mosaik instead each pic under the next in full size regarding wordpress in general i find the set up rather difficult i had to have my brother help me to set up my blog efficiently :  
"

"
191,"hi wordpress team any chance wordpress app will get a dark mode at some point so much better on battery edit 5 to 1 stars like others said below used to work fine now in keeps crashing completely unusable edit 1 to 5 stars for me the crashing problem caused by updates was solved by uninstalling and reinstalling :  
"
192,"works but its frustrating confusing to all hell what is the point of this app when at the end of the day ill be sent to the website to customise anything i cant access all options on the app absolutely useless app for doing anything with options :  
"
193,"very slow on basic smart phones :

"
202,"i dont use wordpress a lot but i appreciate the functionality of it it is featurepacked and contains all that is required to kickstart and maintain a blog :

304,"block editor is consistent with text format but 2 much white spaces between 2 paragraphs need to shrink at 15 or 10 does not have sticky post option for published posts unlike web version is there a way to balance the font size and format of paragraph without the texts going off at random italic and random font size there and here especially between web version and mobile options for font size font style linespacing control are mustneeds regardless of app or internet versions :  
"
305,"this app would have been a huge success but for its avoidable tendency to duplicate content posted on the website i have used it a number of times and the problem still persists when there is an update i would think the problem would be resolved by the developers but it never gets resolved i have had to reinstal and uninstal it several times but i am yet to try again after the last update i have been disappointed several times i dont want to get disappointed again :

"
312,"has options to setup publicize so it can share your posts to social media but it doesnt actually work posts still go to only my selfhosted wordpress blog only so defeats the purpose of having the app if i still have to go to the web to share a post :  
"
313,"wordpress is one of the best website for blogging content writing creating your own website and many more features but the problem is that im not talented enough to utilize its features i am dumb af sorry wordpress edit thnx for replying i meant i dont have proper knowledge to use wordpress means i cant write good content or make a website wordpress is really a great platform for professionals i dont know much about it yet but i hope to learn about wordpress in future :

"
328,"worthless not working due to rpcxml exploit :  
"
329,"the only reason im not using this app is because whenever i upload an image it doesnt upload with the image name instead some randomly generated wp name im not sure if its been fixed or not :  
"
330,"easy to use and good to check stats but the app doesnt sink with the desktop version when you are making amendments to an article i edit in elementor maybe thats the problem :  
"
331,"photo uploads dont always work :  
"
332,"nice app comment section isnt showing for some posts even though its turned on its annoying when people cant make comments on posts do fix this :  
"
333,"no matter how much you develope this app but if you dont give users to edit their post as per seo plugins installed like yoast etc the post ill publish will be absolutely garbage even though if its well written in order to optimize my post with seo i have to by default go to pc and make the changes cause this app doesnt allow me to seo optimize my postarticle so how will this app be mobile friendly please add seo optimization option and ill change the ratings :  
"
334,"after any changes in page when i press upload it stuck at upload even not a 1 get uploaded please fix this issue :

"
337,"been using this app for years now it wont upload media tried everything app support suggested but still doesnt work i dont know what they changed but its worthless to me now i cant update blog :  
"
338,"since i updated to android 10 last week the app doesnt automatically go to the current day it only goes as far as the last day i opened the app from scratch i updated to the latest version of the app feb 2020 but still have the same issue :  
"
339,"no matter how many times i change my password its never right at least not for wordpress ive exhausted my efforts with this app :  
"
340,"this by far expecred my expextation i can blog from phone and i can do almost anything i can do my browser wp keep the awesomeness im sure more updates are on the way now i cant wait to blog every morning :  
"
341,"the main desktop app is absolutely superb the phone app is not good at all i move a picture upwards and the text which it moved above was deleted many of my blocks used do not show up it needs a lot of work to be useful :  
"
342,"im a first time bloggerwriter the tutorials are full of information if you cant find the information youre looking for you can chat with a staff member and they will guide you to the resource it took me a while to learn how wordpress works as i go along with learning the site it gets easier lovewordpress :  
"
343,"build a website never been easier then it :  
"
344,"im unable to write as an editor everytime when i try to upload my blog it shows error messsage everytime :  
"
345,"app will not open on my laptop if i do get it to open it keeps reverting to the block editor which i hate try to switch to classic editor but that rarely works i use the paid version and have my own domain wasted money :  
"
346,"used it for a week and everything was great then all of a sudden it stopped loading data im so stressed out right now i cant upload my posts i wonder what happened :  
"
347,"not very user friendly trying to learn the basics with wordpress and have g trouble navigating thru the app not very user friendly and difficult to learn still having issues after trying again i cant believe this is a program that was recommended very poor user interface :  
"
348,"has access to everything i need but normally wont load it so i have to get on the computer anyway :  
"
349,"i love this app its really good i enjoy wordpress in general and their happy engineers are so prompt and helpful the only complaint i have about the app is when i write an article online and try to continue it on the app while im on the go the article hasnt synced which means my latest edits are not visible on the app i have tried refreshing too does anyone else face this situation so it completely beats the purpose :  
"
350,"i m unable to create a new blog when i click on it i get the error profile is hidden please make it public but it is already public please give a solution for this :  
"
351,"why is this so buggy i save drafts only to lose my progress this is a constant battle and is beyond frustrating i pay for a premium site and the constant setbacks are really making me consider moving to another host the desktop version isnt any better i spent all morning writing a post only to have it lost just awful :  
"
352,"i like it clean and simple however i wish the mobile version had a more robust editor you can type and format but you cant really see how horribly formatted it is until you preview it i copy and paste a lot of content from various sources but i cant see that its a different font style until previewed great on desktop though :  
"
353,"in theory this app could be wonderfully useful for bloggers on the go the design layout and features provide everything i could want and need unfortunately the reliability of the app falls short i run into problems almost every time i use it the whole app will freeze and crash any time i try to add more than a few pictures to a post and what should take fifteen minutes ends up taking two hours it is unbelievably frustrating editing on a mobile web browser is even worse though :  
"
354,"installed it but when i tried to add my two websites it said they were not wordpress sites which is nonsense ok so they have their own urls and not hosted on wordpress site but they are built using wordpress as it doesnt work ive uninstalled it :  
"
355,"i love my wordpress blog i can do a lot lately though im not able to like posts from my computer or phone i dont know if its a google issue an android issue etc ive tried everything to get the like button to work but nothing seems to work i just cannot like my posts my friends posts other blogs posts etc ive sent emails to wordpress but have received no help my emails have gone unanswered its a little frustrating :  
"
356,"good app solid doesnt bog down my system even on an older phone i wish i could change the font and such without having to go to html mode i paste things in from my google docs and for some reason it makes every paragraph go to pre mode so it wont line break and i can only fix it in html mode other than that its a dream :  
"
357,"frustrated this app worked one moment then stopped all of a sudden then i get a new error that says the server is missing xmlrpc methodswell they were there a moment ago right so now i cant login at all on the app i would just really like a smooth interface to my site so i can upload photos easily and this has been a hassle hoping it gets resolved soon :  
"
358,"i dislike this app there are certain reasons about this 1 when we want to embed number of photos from my gallery in my mobile phone into the post it doesnt allow to select more than one image at a time this is so much frustrating that if i have to embed a gallery of say 10 photos then i have to do the embedding process 10 times 2 mobile becomes extremely slow :  
"
359,"slow not responding quickly    :  
"
360,"crashes constantly if your entry is only short youll be fine but a long entry with multiple pictures and it crashes to the point you cannot use the app im doing a travel blog currently and do the initial set up of each update in the app then have to use the website which i find also has problems when using chrome as the down arrows on widgets dont work so im toggling between the app chrome and firefox yes it really is fun not please sort this out asap wordpress :  
"
361,"couple of things could be improved but i feel theyre always trying to improve to make it more similar to the web app and i appreciate that keep it up they could definately improve their ad options though i personally wouldnt click on 99 of them so i might end removing the service which sucks i was hoping to make some extra  :  
"
362,"i wanted to like this app so much it would have been useful unfortunately in the two weeks since installing it it has crashed twice both times losing multiple blog post drafts in the process losing local drafts to get a message which says posts couldnt be refreshed at this time lost posts lost time very frustrating to say the least :  
"
363,"i like how wordpress keep improving each day but i miss the old days when the devs offer various themes from the clean and elegant look to unique themes like chalkboard to basic users like me its quite sad that these unique themes are no longer available or if theyre still available you have to upgrade your site to business in order to be able to modify the csshtml besides i dont know why justify for paragraph is no longrr available on the newest block editor :  
"
364,"wonderful app would give it a five except for the serious delay on updates between edits when switching between differnt appliances is the only time when i have that problem :  
"
365,"installed and clicked sign up got sent a link in an email which took me back to the app which asked me to sign up round and round we go tried copying the link and pasting it in my browser instead it says link expired is this a joke uninstalled :  
"
366,"ive been using this since 2012 this version has something weird happening when i try to select categories strange things happen causing frustration if i select a category it doesnt show a check mark if i go to deselect uncategorized it erases all of the categories i noticed a very faint check mark when i switch off a category the problem seems to be the check mark is white on a white background so it cant be seen :  
"
367,"ive been on an unending search for a platform to express my thoughts blog wordpress gives me an easy to write edit and share options its amazing i got a free domain and beautiful website still working to make it look better its been a great experience my only challenge is that i cant complete edit started on my laptop from my phone :  
"
368,"since changing my wordpress dyad free theme to a paid wordpress theme an expensive one newspaper my site refuses to let me log in from my sony and huawei phones i can log in on my laptop no problem ive cleared cookiescache on both my phones but wordpress still tells me im using the wrong password yet the very same password works perfectly on my laptop also i cant view my stats on my two phones on the rare occassions that i have been able to log in briefly from my two androids :  
"
369,"i have used wordpress for years and really love it there are quite a few little annoying quirks and it drives me insane when the developers make changes to the format that doesnt in my opinion improve the blogging experience and you have to start looking for the features that are now in a different place but overall wordpress is excellent and i wouldnt use anything else ive rated it 4 stars because of the annoying quirks :  
"
370,"this is the best blogging plaatform but can you guys make yoast free its too expensive :  
"
371,"this app is very bad this app is not working everybody dont download and dont use this app this is fake feature :  
"
372,"i cant write comments to posts on my own blog through this app i have brought this up with tech support but it has not been fixed its good for keeping up with the site and checking stats though slower and more limited than google analytics i really have to use the full website on my tablet to do much of anything :  
"
373,"not giving five stars youve still got bugs in my profile section i cant correct notification settings as half of the blogs i follow dont show up i have to go to my pc do it from there next the news feed isnt complete it will show me some new posts then it jumps to three days later next when i try to upload pix and make a post why is there all of this extra html nonsense next i changed my profile icon on the pc not site icon why doesnt it show up here :  
"
374,"more a 45 than a full 5 but i do love the app i dont use it for writing but it is a great way to keep up with other bloggers you follow without needing to use a desktop or laptop the annoying thing about it for writing is that i justify my text and once you open a post to edit it via the app for some reason it left justifies everything when i want to use my phone for actual blogging i sign in via my mobile chrome browser :  
"
375,"i downloaded the app and i wrote most of a blog entry on it it crashed and i lost almost all of it luckily the website had saved 89 of it but i still have to rewrite the rest of it thanks to the crashing and lack of autosaving i wont ever use the app again ever out of all the things this app needed to do not crashing is the most important as a lost blog entry is useless no matter what other features are available :  
"
376,"an excellent app overall but theres still an age old flaw that hasnt been addressed and in fact has worsened in this latest update and thats the issue regarding long posts any post averaging about 152k words is subject to slow and painful editing and once the word count exceeds 3k the app hangs entirely i havent been able to open that one post since ages and being a story writer most of my posts are that long please solve the issue asap thanks and regards :  
"
377,"im not sure what happened but the app is worse than before its extremely buggy now while im writing a post it would suddenly make all of my body into h1 and then freeze id be forced to close the app and reopen it of course since i had to force it to close my changes werent saved it takes a few tries to open the app afterward id stick to the web or mobile version if i were you :  
"
378,"wordpress in general is absolute trash the absolute opposite of user friendly be prepared to run into plenty of ridiculous and unnecessary issues that you will have to spend hours troubleshooting remove a featured image from a post sounds simple right cutting off my leg would be easier do not use this trash 0 stars if i could :  
"
379,"im very disappointed with this app as wordpress is supposed to be the leader for blogging cant save a draft just on the device when theres an internet connection cant create a post draft with pictures when offline no control of the layout of photos when using tiled gallery and no preview of such posts unable to set geolocation for a post this bug has been there in over a year and still hasnt been fixed :  
"
380,"wordpress has been a great app for me for many years it is versatile easy to use to is usable from many devices the only thing i would like to see changed would be that sometimes when the gui was updated some features i liked were removed or changed quite a bit i would have liked the option to retain a legacy version of my gui aside from that tiny element i cant say enough good things about wordpress :  
"
381,"5 stars for wordpress in general blogging with them 11 years but i prefer the web interface the app is good but for working on recent posts only this is an issue for me because i have to scroll for forever to get to my 11 year old posts to edit them also i cant edit events and it doesnt show stats for the event calendar on the app either but they show on a web browser :  
"
382,"note to self do not update this app after each update of yours i keep rolling back to version 78 434 and i wont be updating this app again the more you tinker with this app the more frustrating it becomes no thank you i wont be updating your app again edit to add thank you for your reply the simple answer is for you to put the two versions next to each other 78 434 on the one side and your latest version on the other side then you will be able to experience the differences :  
"
383,"i requested that i sign in through my email which was supposed to be an easier way per wordpress they sent me a link asap but for some reason it wouldnt allow me to sign in i kept getting an error message this link has expired mind you as soon as it was sent to my email i immediately opened it and tried to use it and it kept giving me this same error message above such a waste of time :  
"
384,"fantastic way to keep adding content even when in a coffee shop the app is simple easy to use and doesnt have any major quirks that makes for a frustrating time if youre looking to add content to your site this app has you covered if you need to maintain or run your site this is a solid platform some things are obviously not possible using this altering your sites core structure and design can be clunky but the app isnt really made for that :  
"
385,"couldnt fetch any posts pages images with selfhosted sites :  
"
386,"nowhere near as useful as using a web browser although that ui has also been ruined with the latest updates whilst formatting or blogging to any kind of standard was not good before the app was at least useful for keeping an eye on stats at least that is before the latest upgrade the once mighty wordpress is now sadly looking like the latest victim of imagined convenience destroying actual functionality its a shame but times do change :  
"
387,"it is great and all generally but i have been frequently running into a problem and that is all my saved posts occassionally go missing or the order becomes messy for some reason even though i never log out i have resaved those posts many times over but after a day some of them still ends up being unsaved or the order of posts become wrong automatically please do something about it i use the app on tablet by the way :  
"
388,"dont bother trying to write long meaningful blogs youll be 45 minutes into writing and the app will crash and youll lose everything day one worked flawlesslyday twocrash then you go back in and that tiny message appears you have the basic aka free plan so your activity may be limited perhaps i would have upgraded to a small paid plan had i not just wasted 45 minutes of my life if i attempt this on my phone again and this happens rest assured youll never have a paying customer :  
"
389,"this has been a disaster ever since gutenberg came out even with the recent updates stats still dont work and seems to think i dont have jetpack installed i cant view my posts in the app let alone edit them and schedule posts hasnt worked for months also wjen i try to log into admin from the app to try and work out whats going on if claims my username and password are incorrect wordpress is becoming less and less user friendly with each update :  
"
390,"an app with so many bugs completely unusable the app doesnt register paragraph changes even when the preview shows that the paragraph is changed the actual blog doesnt show the changes you cant space out the images to your likings because that too is not registered the article ends up with stanzas stuck together or images not symmetrically spaced between paragraphs no amount of updates have fixed such problems :  
"
391,"i went to edit a post today in this app and it randomly created and published an entry id already published before a year ago but made a new entry out of it and its all jumbled and in one line across the page this is really bad i cannot have my blog with random publishings happening i didnt authorize i now have to go through my blog and make sure nothing is messed up that was very jarring and i dont feel confident in using this app anymore ill stick to the website :  
"
392,"crashes every time it has an internet connection but that connection is so bad that it cant upload data no connection wifi mobile data turned off is fine it saves localy with a good connection its fine wont upload photos so i have to publish and then reedit when i get internet access with my laptop sort of loses the spontaneity edit it seems to have gotten better with updates but so has our internet availability so its hard to tell :  
"
393,"cannot access my account its a self hosted site everytime i input the username and the password i always get a message incorrect username or password but using the same credentials i can log into my account in browser so how are the credentials wrong i have checked multiple times to ensure that there are no mistakes it is highly irritating :  
"
394,"its been mostly wonderfuli mentioned once that it fails sometimes especially when texts have been edited and i wanna caption a photo whichever way the app does 99 of what i want done without complains there are a few other irregularities like trying to follow someone on the app reblogging previous posts never works on the app liking peoples work that i dont follow if its not on the reader does not work all the time and so i still find myself going to the web to get them done :  
"
395,"app keeps freezing and crashing i got the app so i could upload pictures directly from my phone but the majority of the time something goes wrong i thought using the app would make it more convenient to update my blog but it is more frustrating and time consuming than transferring pictures to my computer and uploading them to my blog from there :  
"
396,"cant even log in or sign up app and website wont let me ive spent over 2 hours trying to troubleshoot this and figure it out and it just wont work im not receiving the troubleshooting emails no one has contacted me back and the faq section is entirely written in french from what i can see which is not helpful to me at all i am very frustrated :  
"
397,"i cant find the plugin option in my wordpress appmobile plz help :  
"
398,"concept behind this app is really great but implementation is very bad every features has error this app shows error in uploading media savings draft visiting themes plugin and pages how could wordpress apps has this much inefficiency try to smoothen experience everything is not working just okey to write offline article worst experience this application is nothing but simple note taking apps for me improvements are needed to keep your reputation dear developer :  
"
399,"i really like this program but i dont like that it automatically uploads my drafts off of my phone when i connect to wifi the whole point of this app is to be able to work offline i have half a dozen partially done blog posts sitting in my online drafts now with no way to edit or complete them without wifi access currently cannot upload my articles due to generic error which will not be explained to me leaving me no ability to fix it update error fixed by customer service :  
"
400,"wordpress sorry i havent reviewed you long ago but im here now platform is great although dont appreciate your new changes has actually took content out of blogs and poetry but getting better all i can say is the next version make it better one thing i dont like is the fact that you keep half a post still to redirect traffic i dont appreciate that any but im sure youll try to correct a few of these things  :  
"
401,"the app is super great to have i appreciate the fact that you can manage multiple wordpress websites in one location it is beyond just great would be awesome if they can add gutenburg to mobile version another feature that i would like to see is to allow integration with the plugins take ecommerce for an example wouldnt it be great to manage a product from your phone wordpress is now about more that just blogging time to adjust to that the most loved feature it has no ads :  
"
402,"complex very complex and very intrusive free account is very limited you cant add plugins unless you upgrade to a paid account a paid personal account still gives you nothing you need to upgrade further to a business account if you click on upgrade just to see how much it is they start spamming you with emails to complete the upgrade in short its complicated and not free :  
"
403,"i usually have no issue with the app but when i recently switched to android ive been having these small bugs that its neverendingly trying to upload some blog post that i cant find or it gets stuck in the notification field and i have to restart my phone to make it go away hope you can look into this asap thanks :  
"
404,"the app kept crashing after i uploaded a draft with pictures it wouldnt load every time i tried to edit a draft that contained pictures it works for drafts that are all text even when i restart the app it will crash whenever i tried to edit posts since i use the app to upload pictures easily this app is now useless compared to the browser which can do the same things without crashing :  
"
405,"wordpress itself is excellent its dead easy to make a sleek modern blog and website the community on wordpress is even better so many really super people the app is generally good but can be glitchy at times especially when viewing image heavy content in their reader its problem free if you keep your files sized appropriately for the web but when folk dont do that it can fail to load for a lot longer than a standard browser eg 10 x longer than google :  
"
406,"i use this app to put pen to paper so to speak when off on my travels ready for final edits on return note i had problems accessing the stats after the app updated and was scratching my head as it didnt recognise the login details i use for my self hosted site finally figured i had to create a wordpress account using those details to access the stats :  
"
407,"the app could use some work its great for when im away from my laptop but some customization features arent present in the mobile app and theres a formatting glitch that makes posting difficult i cannot customize my message write an excerpt or customize my slug when on the mobile app id love it if i could the formatting glitch happens every time i have to go back in my writing and add or delete sentences it will change all previous text to headings pretty great otherwise :  
"
408,"complete and utter garbage doesnt even work properly and its almost completely unintuitive :  
"
409,"takes hours to load why its below the line compared to actual working on desktop at least some features should work on app isnt it :  
"
410,"this app makes writing a post so hard the words doesnt appear right away and when they do they come out all wrong it changes sentences and makes everything in need of an edit its annoying typing words and not seeing them right away only to come out full of errors and twice i dont know how to explain it at first i thought it was the tablet but i have tried it in different android devices of different generations and with every single one i have the same problem please fix this i want to be able to write whenever i have a chance and having to carry my laptop with me just complicates things :  
"
411,"i finished typing over 800 words and i was trying to do a little editing before i publish boom the whole post got missing from the app please work on it never trust this app it crushes at crucial moments i taught it will not happen again after updating and using the app for some time but it has happened today again on the 19th of september 2019 i feel really bad right now :  
"
412,"when i first downloaded this app 7 mo ago it worked beautifully i now have 2 blog sites on wordpress for the last three days it had began freezing the edit page and freezing on the screen and keyboard my phone doesnt do this when its on the web or when im using another app so thats how i know the problem isnt my phone yesterday evening after the update installed the app wouldnt open at all now i need yall to fix this so i can give you a five star rating :  
"
413,"this review is for wordpress app not for wordpress service in general ive been using wordpress for blogging since 2011 and so far im very satisfied its easy and intuitive however this app sometimes doesnt really synchronize with wordpress web and i have lost some updates because of that i cant really use this app for heavy editing because it turns very slow so i use this app mainly for checking statistics it has a great notification tool i like it :  
"
414,"the app works perfectly for about two months and if i had rated it within that period i would have given it 5 stars after about 2 months we start getting generic error on one site lets call it website1 i had two websites i uninstalled and reinstalled the wp app and the website1 couldnt be reembedded because i got a new error on it error 403 xmlrpc but website2 got reembedded now after two months website2 is giving me a generic error and i am scared of reinstalling wp :  
"
415,"adding images used to be very easy especially multiple at a time now ever since they changed to block editing adding them is five times as many clicks as before and you can only add them one at a time why cant we select multiple images and have them automatically inserted into multiple image blocks my blog is image heavy and it takes forever to put them all into a post :  
"
416,"its a great app 5 stars tho i have a problem on my wordpress site i enabled recaptcha plugin as an additional level of security on my wordpress site through desktop and mobile browsers it works because it shows the plugin so i can check it and login but if i go through wordpress android app there is no recaptcha plugin and i cant login on my web site to work on it wordpress through mobile browsers especially opera or opera touch works perfect but i want to use the app instead how do i solve this :  
"
417,"for an official app of one of the most popular blogging platform on the internet its not very friendly or responsive to changes on the web version one none of my pictures could be uploaded to the media and two deleted websites still remained in the list until i finally figured out how to remove them yet it didnt do it cleanly never changed for years probably will uninstall finally :  
"
418,"app refuses to upload every image and every blog post what is going on :  
"
419,"its a good app to do quick post on the go but if you have the app on two devices phone and tablet they dont sync up with on another i lost half a draft post that i did yesterday on tablet to come to the phone to only have half the post that i did 4 days ago disappointed that u have to write it all out again :  
"
420,"useful features but was more stable in the past versions have had to uninstall and reinstall app to fix some issues doesnt support latest image format webp :  
"
421,"i am a bit confused about which rate to give as such an app must be really hard to program but well first on my desktop version i have 2 languages for articles but on the app only the articles in one language appear also sometimes when i update an article on the app the changes doesnt show on pc even though it is said saved online even worse it erases all the changes i made once on an article cause of autoupdate so the latest version got erased some other things i dont remember :  
"
422,"okay so this app works and then doesnt work i cant approve comments i cant reply to comments now i cant even draft posts because they wont uploadsave it fails continuously i like to draft on mobile the edit on the web drafting worked just fine last week otherwise its a nice app the recent update looks nice and less dated but the functionality is decreasing :  
"
423,"its a decent platform for expression it just doesnt have much reach :  
"
424,"no longer works i have a self hosted website the app worked until several updates ago when it stopped posting to the site i uninstalled reinstalled logged in again and now it will connect to the site but wont do anything wont show posts that are on the site or allow me to post anything site is working fine :  
"
425,"the only problems i have with this app are that i cant see posts from more than about a year and a half ago i like reading really long serial stories that might go on for several years and i cant reach the beginning the other thing is that i cant access the table of contents for any site :  
"
426,"this app doesnt work on my phone or should i say my country nigeria because all hes saying is a network error occurred please check your network and try again but when am using my gmail to login it shows we cant connect to your gmail account try again later whats going on :  
"
427,"it was a good app and i definitely would have rated it 5 stars if it didnt started crashing again and again and again every time i open it this happens mostly when i am editing a draftpost or writing one i would have definitely recommended this app to everyone if it didnt crash so often :  
"
428,"the app is horrible and if youre thinking of blogging from your phone youve been warned the posts lose formatting when hou want to edit them after posting all paragraphs are gone inserting photos breaks words in the middle photo uploads hang and keep hanging the app doesnt support raw format but lets you choose raw format to upload which results in upload failures i will not buy any paid plan for this type of service :  
"
429,"i like the app because its great to check stats and maybe read a few new posts on your feed but for editing its a bit annoying because there isnt an option to save while you work it lets you save and then kicks out of the post and then you have to go back in to carry on my phone battery died while i was working and i lost all my work on that post because i hadnt saved yet :  
"
430,"the app regularly crashes as i type it freezes and grinds to a crawl just as often the app fails to recognize letters as i type them and it deletes spaces after words a solution is to work in html mode it appears that these bugs are only an issue when you have images display while editing a post the more images the worse the problem it seems unbelievable that wordpress with its qa resources cant fix these issues :  
"
431,"i love this app i could do edits on my posts and publish them much the same way as doing that on a web browser however of late i noticed the notifications dont appear esp for likes and comments from visitors not sure if it is due to an update would appreciate if this issue is checked out and rectified :  
"
432,"wordpress has been an overall easytouse app for my blog however with the block update images wont upload :  
"
433,"revised 2 i trying to use this again and its still crashing when i use voice dictation when i load pictures first i need to load the pictures first because of the nature of the job that im using this for it seemed to be working the other day on a test but now it is crashing again keeps crashing whenever i load more than 3 photos and use the voice dictation it crashes on my samsung j4 this was not a problem on my j2 extremely frustrating and pretty much impossible for me to use on the j4 :  
"
434,"worst user interface you cant find or do anything it will take you years to get something right specially if your building a website from your mobile device i spent entire day working on this i cant even log into my wordpress account on the internet even when im entering the username and password exactly thats showing in my app so disspaointed :  
"
435,"useless app if one must disable essential site security in order to use it and it seems that everything you need to build a free website is conveniently wrapped up in a wordpress premium subscription pointless if i already host my own instances where plugin installation is free wordpress security is akin to swiss cheese without some 3rd party security :  
"
436,"like many other people unable to fully use this app as it seems to have an image restriction when you wantto upload and attach an image i have gone through all the troubleshooting and even changed settings on the hostserver and blog still no difference in short i have to resize the photo in another app on my phone then attach that smaller photo into the wordpress post only an issue through the app following various searches and tests this seems to be an issue with the app despite the settings i make on the app please fix this issue please :  
"
437,"good grief the new block editor is awful for sharing links from a browser ive turned it off dont make it so thats the only editing option please :  
"
438,"i used wordpress for years and deleted my blog for a fresh start i do all my writing on mobiledocs im pretty sure you know where this is going i cannot cutpaste without losing all my formatting i use keep to jot down ideas and docs to flesh them out ive tried saving them as drafts but i end up with so many drafts that it makes it hard to find what i need i know there is a plugin for pc but i do not own a pc i use a blutooth keyboard if i could keep my format :  
"
439,"since last update the app is crashing all the time even dont upload a media file always say something went wrong please try again normally a app work good after update but with wordpress no longer apply this rule the app is crashing all the time you cant write a post or upload a photo for a video file i am clear the catch and also install and uninstall the app several times but the problem is going same :  
"
440,"thought it would be a good idea but unfortunately not 1st problem arose with publishing plain text error uploading despite lte connection finally managed an hour after the original attempt now a problem with uploading a pic from the phone granted app access to storage removing it as the sole purpose was to publish more efficiently without the need of sending pics back and forth :  
"
441,"needs a spellcheck function esp since default keyboard autocorrect doesnt work in the app and the app doesnt appear in my recent app tray i cant even tell if its opened and still running in the background the editor is quite weird too since it doesnt apply all the functions i added blockquote etc when i want to post the thing and have to use html mode to make sure in the end also can the allow comments etc functions be added to the post settings too do consider thank you :  
"
442,"there should be a way to manage saved posts sort them put into collections etc moreover the number of saved posts shouldnt be limited actually the old ones dont get unsaved when i view them on browser then choose view in reader the posts are still marked as saved but they are not displayed in saved posts so i cant access them offline which is the reason i use the save function and when visiting someones blog i prefer seeing an outline of their posts which can help me access any post of that person over an incomplete list of posts sorted chronically which doesnt display all of their posts some of them are only accessible on the app through browser so whats the point of using the app over browser :  
"
443,"i really like worpress and use it multiple times per day since around the time of the the android update i repeatedly get a couldnt perform operation error when i try to upload photos to media from my phone this happens using my data plan and on wifi it also happens in different locations not just on my own wifi :  
"
444,"oftenly makes lagging and finally the app will hang or crash then my writing is lost already clear up all data but never solved the problems after updated now the problem still remains the same after i wrote many lot of words including photos then it will become laggingvery slow wasting my time to complete the writings suddenly it will error the wordpress has stopped :  
"
445,"i enjoy using this app sure it has steep learning curve but once you take your time and try to learn how it functions its pretty simple cms plus theres tutorials online in case youre stuck i was very frustrated and confused when i first started using it a big plus is that it doesnt take long to load webpages unlike wix sorry devs 55 for wordpress :  
"
446,"one of the most problematic and difficult apps on my device this is even more unfortunate since millions of users out there trust and use worpress while this weak app is the only real smartpgone tool available to access your site after logging in relatively quick and smoothly things start by looking promising but as soon as you start to try publishing or sharing media the app starts bombarding error messages i have already contacted support and forum without an answer :  
"
447,"this app is terrible not only does it bug out while you are writing by randomly converting your paragraph to a heading format it will not sync with activity you do on the actual wordpress site you will find published pages reverted to old drafts when you load them here it is incredibly annoying just use the website :  
"
448,"i am enjoying the app it is not super user friendly when you are trying to add additional pages i tried to use the help function not much help other wise adding a blog easy peasy making sure that the blog reflects on the right page not so much :  
"
449,"hey thank you for this app it really helps me build my blog about our homeschooling but whenever i type or scroll a post down as i edit it it keeps moving like an earthquake except it is moving up and down and up and down please help me with this i get really dizzy while i type a blog post because of this problem :  
"
450,"seriously everything in the page is saying page not found why pls dont know what to do have contacted many developers still up to no avail :  
"
451,"i reinstalled app on my new phone but when i go to my post sections i think app try to fetch my all posts in one go which leads my site to 503 temporary unavailable my usage statistics on memory and entry processes on my hosting panel goes very high sometimes i also got the error of resource limit reached so just want to suggest that dont try to fetch all posts in one goplease give load more or pagination please reply if not got my point filter for published scheduled and draft :  
"
452,"i need to say this please do something so that what ever is being typed gets saved right away i am a very messy person i had to type few loongg texts two to three times because of my own negligence of removing the app from task bar by mistake and i loose the whole text its really upsetting could you please manage to save the text as soon as its typed apart from this its not excellent app i want to change the rating will be waiting for the update :  
"
453,"update thanks a lot for replying so fast ive got what i wanted the app is good but its missing a very important feature why cant i set a featured image for my blog posts is there any option do so from the app if yes then how guide me please ill change the rating in no time as soon as find the option :  
"
454,"i like that i can make a blog post using this app on my phone but after the recent update i can no longer type a word as it refreshes itself making me login to my laptop and type what i needed to type which is very inconviennient please take a look into this and fix this :  
"
455,"apps for web application are developed to lessen the burdenease the work but this app does exactly oppositewhenever i write blog post using app the default font it takes is something elseeven after trying to change font alignment etc it wont be savedsometimes i have faced the issues like drafts are uploaded without my permission to my bloghashtags are deleted on its ownwhen v have to use the web application at the end of the day to format the post no use to keep the apphence uninstall :  
"
456,"really wish there was a way to leave my work in progress to check another source and return to find it still there i spend more time trying to find where it disappeared to than actually writing the piece can something be done about this if i open another page it doesnt mean the piece is done or that it should be sent to a draft file :  
"
457,"the latest version of the apps is so buggy and does not even work to publish that it made me wonder if the programmers are sleeping on the job the older version works just fine but not the latest one it keep saying failed to refresh and nothing can be published new wordpress sites cannot be added either please read the reviews submitted here start solving the problems instead of giving us dumb template responses :  
"
458,"i am so sorry i ever installed it this app is malfunctioning in several ways relating to strange displays of blog text once overlapping so the post displayed under or over the photo of prior post the next time yesterday so the text displayed way out to the right reader has to swipe far far to the keft to view it what a disaster for a writer trying to create a following of readers :  
"
459,"it has been cool but the subscription rate needs to drop :  
"
460,"this app becomes more and more idiotic stats are badly organized slow and do not give relevant data posting and editing tools are worthless this last stupid update is enough for me uninstall edit i used this app for stats and implementing insights was bad loading is slow and with the last update you cannot view individual posts new wordpress post editor in a browser lacks a lot options in app even more options missing concerning pictures buttons for formatting hidden 500 limit :  
"
461,"countless bugs and glitches copypaste erasing parts of unselected text when underlining other parts above captions disappearing and becoming regular text creating decorated texts from nowhere when copying from a txt editor editor is so laggy when text is above 4500 characters with pictures i end up spending a lot of time correcting my text instead of writing it new block editor is even worse and youre forced to use it difficult to switch it off samsung sg8 updated gboard up :  
"
462,"best blogging app hands down you can create a new account or blog or website from scratch on your phone it can be a little tricky sometimes but once you get over the learning curve its great drains the hell out of battery though not really sure why :  
"
463,"im no longer able to upload photos to my blog posts also previous blog posts arent loading for me the purpose of the app is to update my blog so without this function the app is useless to me wow still have this issue despite contacting wordpress many times do not use this app it doesnt function :  
"
464,"after paying for business account i am not able to log in cz otp sms is not receiving on the registered mobile number when contacted the wp support team they are giving lame excuse and telling me to contact my mobile service provider well i am not able to login to my wp account horrible customer support and experience dont pay for this guys go with google cloud or firebase :  
"
465,"i mostly use the app to upload photos which is super convenient i dont like typing lengthy stuff on my phone and use a lot of plugins that affect publication options so its not practical for me to use most of the other features on a regular basis :  
"
466,"having scheduled some blogs to go live while on holiday and then noticing some highly visible formatting errors and typos this app saved me from having to pay for pc access to fix the errors the alternative was to unpublish the blog i dont think using just this app on my phone to write blogs from scratch is practical but on a reasonably sized tablet may well be usable with a keyboard and mouse one improvement would be to include the block justification controls hence the 4 score :  
"
467,"the app itself is terrible most of the functionality doesnt work or works on a much more limited way than the desktop version the app is basically a way to check basic stats on my phone update customer support recommendation to turn off all plugins one by one and check app and possibly uninstall jetpack in other words app will remain glorified stat checker :  
"
468,"absolutely shocking i regularly have to save drafts and then go to my laptop to post as the app is incapable of doing it currently looking for a better platform to run my websiteif this is the best wordpress can do its embarrassing if i wanted to post from my laptop id use that i got the app because i needed to post on the go shockingly poor :  
"
469,"i want to be able to visit my actual blog site in the app without having to click on my post to get there otherwise very convenient way for me to post also there might be some bug issues because a post will still say draft after it is already posted :  
"
470,"while i like having easier access to posting on my site it is incredibly difficult to edit once ive posted when i make a mistake i have to open up in a search engine and log in just to edit it shouldnt be that difficult to edit my own work on the site :  
"
471,"app was really good before but after the latest update its getting so many glitches and getting slow if i have to paste something curser will automatically go to top of the page and i have to scroll down it happens every time and app get hang so oftenly please do something about it :  
"
472,"doesnt work i need to be able to manage my website from my mobile device since i am not always by my computer i was excited when i saw that wordpress has an app but then i was quickly disappointed because nothing loads in the app i cant see my pages i cant see my posts i cant even write and upload a post whats the point of the app if i cant manage my website :  
"
473,"thats fantastic app ive really liked this app because it help me to publish my experience about anything but the problem is i cant add audio file to it why plz :  
"
474,"hi there let me first tell you that i appreciate having this platform to share the gospel butthis site has one drawback that makes wordpress a very poor choice for online discussions specifically you can not delete or edit anything you say on someone elses site but the admin of the site you commented on can delete or edit anything you say on their site had i realized this early on i wouldnt have used wordpress but now i have so much data into wordpress that its hard to leave :  
"
475,"the ui is decent the working around the app is easy to grasp and crisp to use its a very good app my only gripe with it is its notification neither reply feature works nor the like feature you click but app says reply cant be sent now or post cant be liked :  
"
476,"i have to log in each time they claimed my password was wrong im sick of this it is impossible for a password to be wrong since we make them up anyway in this case i used my regular password i used before and it worked they lied by saying it was wrong password i think it is run by google so of course it is evil :  
"
477,"the app needs extensive revision no support for forms most of the jetpack elements are displayed as unsupported blocks it needs a lot if improvement not even formatted text displays correctly in app although its perfect on the website overall not very useful to manage a rich content or media website :  
"
478,"great app use it daily only negative is they force you to use an editor i personally dont care for :  
"
479,"new stats interface not consistent by date between views example clicking on view more rarely expands the list of visitor viewed posts for a given date instead it switches dates and the list changes to the one for the different date expanded list of first dates stats accessed remains inaccessible :  
"
480,"this app has some serious bugs i cant read the other blogs when i go to the blog section certainly the app closes after that it cant be reopened until someone reinstalls it completely or clears its data from settings please fix this i love this app but for reading other blogs everytime i have to open my browser and have to navigate manually which feels exhausting maybe this is happening due to my os version which is currently 50 lollipopbut still what ever the issue is it should have to be fixed :  
"
481,"i thought this would help me with my business site i have using wordpress so i can deal with orders customers and product stuff even when im unable to get to my computer customers do not like to wait this is completely useless i cannot get to any of the functions i need and nothing works in it everything has an error i havent had it installed for even 30 mins and i am already taking it off i will have to use brower on my phone to get anything done :  
"
482,"love the app and the website its fast to open and update and easy to navigate sometimes the app or browser complaints or asks me to update to blocks dont remember which one this happens when i create the post on app and view in browser or vice versa please look into it :  
"
483,"its terrible application keeps crashing every now and then when saving an edit and even when you are not saving but just using the application its very frustrating i dont know what update you guys made to this version but it needs to be review and identified what is causing the crash thanks :  
"
484,"doesnt like uploading pics from app works on browser fine about annoying to have to not be able to update through app tried changing permissions on folders and changing file size to no avail :  
"
485,"not good experience because when suddenly language chnged when i was creating profile web then i was unable to recover my domain and site :  
"
486,"terrible keeps coming up with couldnt sink doesnt show me any of my blogs cant go on setting cant post nothing the only thing that works is view my site it worked the first day i downloaded the app then i did some work to my site put some posts on etc and after that the app just went terribly wrong whoever runs this app seriously need to fix it coz its just a joke if i want to blog when im out and dont have a laptop with me i cant coz this app dont work sort this app out now :  
"
487,"i still find the block editor unusable because there is no way to convert an existing block to another type you have to delete and create a new one before pasting in content pasting doesnt even work with titles and heading blocks they just revert to paragraphs :  
"
488,"i downloaded it and after 2 days of using it it started crashing it took 15 seconds in between updating that it crashed and booted you out i was really hoping that i would have this app for on the go updates unfortunately it doesnt work well enough to do that :  
"
489,"not uploading image            :  
"
490,"it is not what i was looking for am trying to find a website builder for my tablet i can actually do some of the code for i dont want to fill in line and add pictures i want to code it all im pretty sure the regular version you can do this although from a phone it would be hard but a tablet with keyboard is no different then a laptop :  
"
491,"nearly no function worked properly the app updated older versions of post drafts so that the recent progress was deleted the draft mode does not show contents like lists or images uninstalled the mobile bowser version works fine while the app is causing more problems than is solves :  
"
492,"i cant even log into my account any more this app is useless its a real tragedy as i used to be able to assemble posts and manage multimedia on the fly but now i cant even get into my account why the hell cant wordpress make its own app work any more :  
"
493,"its ok sometimes the post making app doesnt have the functionality you want and sometimes it just doesnt sorm as well as wordpress in a mobile browser which is why the three i mostly use it for notifications but even then theyre better dealt with in a browser :  
"
494,"its easy to use and free but it is a bit cumbersome and you cant add more than one photo at a time which is very time consuming :  
"
495,"i used to be able to update my website between my phone and my pc but now the phone app cant do anything it doesnt pull up anything from my website i cant access my posts or drafts and it can only save things to my device which i cant even find the concept is great but it doesnt work so who cares :  
"
496,"what is wrong with the developer of this app you will update your app after three days it will stop working and be showing to update again the app was good but now too much changes many things are not working again you cant even add a media to your publishment again very annoying app :  
"
497,"middrafted blog post and now its all gone because of my decision to use this stupid app all i wanted to do was input a source for my information but switching apps isnt something these app developers considered to anyone reading use an external editor and then paste everything required onto wordpress via desktop :  
"
498,"would be amazing if every time i tried using the app it didnt tell me i had already used my attempts to get in to use and to cone back in 20mins i have had more unsuccessful attempts at trying to use it than the handful of time ive actually gotten through :  
"
499,"nice app really gives overview for our website yet the difference is when you check your page with this app apparently it didnt save your ip address and thus add personal view into the ppst view it is not a bad thing tho i would prefer if i dont cheat on the viewer statistic  :  
"
500,"for last 2 months i am facing huge problem sometimes wordpress is not opening sometimes the picture is not uploading even after several times and the biggest problem is while working on wordpress sometimes my phone is getting hanged please solve the issues :  
"
501,"well the app used to work well until a few days back i cant view my published posts or my media anymore it keeps saying unable to refresh i cant even reply to a comment now im just stuck cuz it has refused to publish any post anymore please fix this :  
"
502,"kind of disappointed only can make new pages post and blog text on phone but cannot add pictures from phone its just a phone app its understandable why its like that hope our technology can improve one day for lazy us to fully make websites from our phone so long :  
"
503,"app has stopped working on my phone every time i try to upload an image to my site it crashes which is disappointing considering i pay for the business account very inconvenient i have send feedback a thousand times but the problem persists :  
"
504,"the app has a lot of bugs i cant type my blog post like i want because is doing some kind of double text thing the app just randomly close and update take a day or 2 can you guys update and fix some of the minor bugs the app just need a cleaning experience :  
"
505,"unable to use the app on my phone why fix something that aint broke refusing to switch to the new editor which is extremely inflexible i now cant use the wordpress classic editor i cant even use the web version what may we know is going on :  
"
506,"lacking basic functionality the app does not show up in your list of active apps if you switch to another app you lose everything the app is incapable of saving offline drafts so its basically useless for writing something while offline :  
"
507,"worst experiencedont download this app i could not sign up for the first time it was like marrygo roundblogger is best :  
"
508,"its super plain easy and super one request only custom post types guys nowadays its not just posts and pages if you give content access to custom post types would boost the functionality 100 keep the awesome work guys :  
"
509,"its pretty easy to use however i often experience that my pictures fails to upload and eventually it wont upload my post at all if my internett is not top quality but if i have top quality on my internett i have no issues at all happy with it :  
"
510,"dont really like the new block editor not always works good and i prefer the classic editor still use it till now stats is useless the old version is better current versions stats and block editor is absolutely not am improvement :  
"
511,"facing a new issue after latest update wordpress is crashing abruptly every time i opened it click on new draft tab and then clicking edit not able to add even single letter it becomes very slow went to black screen after clicking edit button then after 34 sec the post open :  
"
512,"still in limbo trying to choose proper layout for my website it appears that the majority of layouts are tailored for financial gain small business type websites or travel photography sharing websites however im sure ill eventually find one thatll function for the purpose i am seeking i hope :  
"
513,"i cant upgrade my site plan i just see a list of all the plans but no chance to choose :  
"
514,"in my previous review i told about status bug status are not showing correctly i gave a feedback to on mail and you replied that youre fixing this soon but its gone more then 1 week this is wrost app nothing is good after new update old version is good i want old version :  
"
515,"i have more expectations from the official wordpress application its just ok to view your site visitors but when it comes to writing a post i feel like it has dropped the ball just a plain simple editor thus the three star rating :  
"
516,"its odd that the app doesnt support recaptcha i was using it without any notable hiccups until my admin added the recaptcha and now the app wont log me into my account anymore because it doesnt load the captcha check please do that and ill make it 5 stars :  
"
517,"hello wordpress the app is really nice and very helpful just wanted one fever can we get post sorting filter in the blog post right now it shows all post in the blog post it is very difficult to find out the post that we required :  
"
518,"after the latest update the current days statsviews dont show up correctly instead i see the stats for the day before other than this i have never had any problem with this terrific app i am sure this will be fixed soon :  
"
519,"basically a good blogging system but the are to many ways of doing the same thing you get a different editor deciding on how you own it there should just be one handling images is clumsy :  
"
520,"this app is so bad i literally almost cried out of frustration i had to do 10 blogs as part of my assignment for school and god dam im glad its over this app literally glitches like its part of the matrix and wont let you type like thats wack its a blog it should let you type i dont recommend to anyone and anyone who who has the displeasure like me and had to use this wordpress are poor unfortunate souls i said jesus christ so much writing these blogs i think the holy ghost might appear :  
"
521,"i have been trying to download this app for a while now but it doesnt download just keeps on loading for a long time :  
"
522,"a recent update has just borked my stats reporting with inaccurate results for weekly monthly and yearly stats was previously a really good interface not sure what has gone wrong with the update :  
"
523,"its great the only reason i fine 4 starts is because you cant do everything here that you can oh a desktop but other sites like google wont let you do any editing on a phone so this is still the best in can think of :  
"
524,"its okay keeps crashing and the block editor isnt good :  
"
525,"needs a remove formatting button not everybodys on the latest os asus zenpad still running android 6 still i use this app daily in conjunction with the web site for the aforementioned missing function :  
"
526,"post drafts are missing in stats insight section views bar is missing only showing numbers so far these irregularities found hope you will look into this consider earlier version it was more friendly :  
"
527,"i cannot believe the data you use i used 5gb of my data on 40minutes of using your app what a joke i have a data usage app and it showed worpress to use 5gb i was not uploading pictures i was listening to a voice recording on someones blog will send through the screenshot :  
"
528,"i am thoroughly fedup with your incessant updates because your app is going downhill really fast i have rolled back to version 78 434 as it remains the most pleasant and stable version to date i will not be updating your app again as it is painfully clear that you have absolutely no idea what the heck you are doing edit to add simply place v78 434 next to whatever new version youve got use both in the same manner and experience the differences for yourself im not updating again :  
"
529,"easy to use on my phone pc my only complaint is that unpublished items can only be found on the platform where the post was started in other words i cant start on my phone finish on my pc :  
"
530,"ive tried multiple times to try to post on my blog thru the app it fails to post this is very frustrating that i go through all to make a blog only for my posts to fail to load saved to my device does nothing for getting it to my blog :  
"
531,"introduces one to a world of interesting people i like the app but wonder sometimes why wordpress suggests that i share posts on social media to increase views when i have done so to several sites the day before and had multiple comments and likes on those sites but wp shows me having less than onethird as many views or worse people follow my blog or like a specific post but somehow there are no views that day the notifications are useful but sometimes seem inaccurate :  
"
532,"didnt even let me make a username tried to change it but it automatically assigns you a username once you click the email link it sucks because i wanted to have a blog name that did not include my personal name :  
"
533,"overall wordpress is a great app except that it needs a block button to prevent or eliminate online bullies now my only alternative is to block comments or delete my blog already i was forced to delete several blog posts because of haters and flamers also i cant change my credit card information on this app :  
"
534,"the app was so good and useful until the last update stats page could not be made worse than this its showing wrong stats just bring back the old version please there was nothing wrong with it :  
"
535,"app will not upload photos in posts app will not upload feature photo the app will not publish posts i get different errors every attempt app has save draft of post but now i must move to a desktop to complete my uploads and to publish new post :  
"
536,"its a great app for my blogging but sometimes its shuts me out and i have to log in again and it doesnt log in immediately apart from that annoying log in issue its a great app :  
"
537,"this has to be the worst blogging app ive ever used publishing pages almost literally takes an act of congress sometimes you can do it in the app sometimes you have to click through 100 pages from the app to the website if you can find it :  
"
538,"love it for years ive been messing with html css and php to get the most basic site going its good to know whats going on in the background but with wordpress you just have to worry about your content and worry less about the mechanics :  
"
539,"wordpress has been around long enough it doesnt need my review but here we are 4 stars because im slow and am having difficulty with some of the features so i spend hours researching how to do something when id rather not :  
"
540,"the app crashes systems and other apps slows down or even shuts down while you are using it terrible :  
"
541,"searching for photos in my wordpress photo upload library still very much lacks proper results :  
"
542,"i have one wordpress domain that site i can do everything on desktop or pc but mobile application i cannot post anything like video image link photo its notified the file not uploaded generic error pls solve our problem :  
"
543,"im not into the bells and whistles at this point so im just using the basic features it works for what i want it to to do which is as an online journal im not sure how to do more elaborate layouts etc yet :  
"
544,"it is absolutely annoying how i cannot customize my site on the app why does it need to redirect to the browser the app constantly hangs it is not as efficient as when you use it on pc :  
"
545,"its a good little app for keeping track of your sites but the posts section doesnt seem to work for me it gets stuck on the loading screen other than that well worth a download :  
"
546,"i had noticed and reported a few bugs months ago still not seeing them fixed so rating is based on the fact that customer care is zero other than that nothing special just an app to manage your blog on the go :  
"
547,"nice app just got the pc version but why cant the pc version be used offline like the moblie version :  
"
548,"its fairly easy to use but sometimes some typed words and even sentences get erased some features arent available when using block mode which could be of some help :  
"
549,"i installed the app twice but both times it wouldnt work error is wordpress isnt responding :  
"
550,"i think this is the best blog tool bar none it lets you create your blog and hosts your blog site you can upload pictures and videos to your blog bar none this is the best blog tool bar none :  
"
551,"love it just what i need to update my blog on the go only critique is that when i edit photo uploads to change the size to medium no saveapply button appears so im unable to customize the size :  
"
552,"it gets irritating when i try to customize my site on the app and it opens a chrome tab for me to do my editing there why create an app if it wont allow users to do editing work there ive always known wordpress for being userfriendly what happened :  
"
553,"great app to check on your blog stats reader or make small edits to a post what it doesnt have is the like star in comments so i dont use it for reading or responding to comments on my blog :  
"
554,"had the free edition of wordpress was going to purchase the premium edition but the people at wordpress began removing my posts for no reason had friends try to find a couple of my stories but saw the message from wordpress this posting has been removed by wordpress uninstalled :  
"
555,"i love wordpress im still getting used to the phone app so i havent used it as much as ive used wordpress on my computer its very convenient but it takes much longer to write a post :  
"
556,"good but the app worked for me to a point i havent used it much over the last few months but when i try to publish a post even a test post it doesnt work i also noticed it connects to my blog just fine but has issues posting :  
"
557,"hate this app tried to add my self hosted site only for it to say my site is not a wordpress site and then because they wouldnt log me me in with my site credentials i ended up being blocked by my security feature for 20 days i wish i could transfer my site completely away altogether :  
"
558,"cool user friendly but i cant find upgrading option or domain option on the app :  
"
559,"the app gives me easy access to my blogs and followed sites i find it easier to post from my desk top computer but thats because i dont like typing on my phone that much :  
"
560,"worthless app tried over and over to update my website which i do every day on desktop from my phone i hit update and the app acts like the page is updated go on to check online and nothing has changed fix your app :  
"
561,"slow to upload photos and to sync with online version making it difficult to track the changes ive made to a post sometimes slow to publish :  
"
562,"i type an article then save it in draft for edit it later when next day while i am editing that article app get bugs and it stuck for minutes then that lag is gone and my edited article is also gone this app wasted my 10hrs of work in a minute :  
"
563,"0 star app because we cant add website shows require xmlrpc method are missing on server but in feb 2019 everything was fine on the application after it become wrost otherhand when i login it by chrome browser on mobile its working good so i think you create a app with bugs sorry deleting app :  
"
564,"good for jotting down drafts and doing other minor things but often gets confused with versions made pn computer i had to rewrite an entire article from memory because it overwrote the one id written on my pc could definitely be better :  
"
565,"its a really great app it doesnt come with adds and its easy to use :  
"
566,"app is good but the recent change to the stats is terrible they are less intuitive and the map overlay no longer displays please fix this or set it back to the old orange graphs version :  
"
567,"needs so much work the reader is the worst bit of programming ive ever come across always takes you to discover i dont give a about the discover page :  
"
568,"cant export posts trying to move content between my two wordpress blogs export creates invalid content when i import the file wp that the email download links the wp import runner rejects it doesnt replicate remote changes made on server on my mac to my app think it is because apps local time reset to 01011970 after last update so i get sync errors when i edit posts :  
"
569,"i love that it keeps what i type as drafts and uploads when it can too many other options lose my edits when they cant connect the main thing i need added is nested bullets :  
"
570,"reliable experience for me so far doing what it is supposed to do i wish if i could control everything in a new post just like as if i was using the full wordpress dashboard :  
"
571,"it used to work beautifully but now it takes forever to load the posts and sometimes it wont load at all this app has transitioned from being the best to one of the worst :  
"
572,"so far so good i would request that the app should enable me to read the full text of the post rather than a part followed by a read more link that requires opening the browser :  
"
573,"has its quirks but it works pretty nicely and is reasonably robust nicer experience than the browser on my android tablet pity it doesnt have an offline composition mode for writing entries when away from the net :  
"
574,"i keep having to uninstall and then reinstall before having to wait a day or so to be able to login before it works for me to edit or publish posts again what is going on this is extremely annoying :  
"
575,"ok what are you guys doing with the new things you make it so hard to edit the post when i tried to block one sentence and made it italic it kept crush and take me out of the post please just make it like it used to be :  
"
576,"good app little problem thoughi am yet to configure it to automatically share my blog posts on the social media platforms it keeps showing an error occurred :  
"
577,"im not sure your solution to bypassing recaptcha has been thought out well if at all where are your security considerations in this line of thinking your latest app also ignores deleting of sites delete a site close the app open the app and the deleted site is back  :  
"
578,"great app i use this as my daily driver but please add support for emojis as they appear as blank in the comments feature also the app doesnt support the 189 aspect ratio :  
"
579,"i love it but it dosent keep site notifications on please fix :  
"

1706,"buggy login                    :  
"
1707,"in the past few updates the app made my sites stats completely unaccessible and reachable i am no longer able to check any of my stats without not only getting my phone frozen but also the app i constantly have to shut down the app and reopen it to get the same issue all the time hence this even if it manages to load in i can only view the monthly stats and not the dailyweekly ones the widget also doesnt show anything other than its unable to show the statistics for my site update the latest update seems to have fixed the issue :  
"
1708,"previously a five star application however after the most recent update problems abound i emailed support i will update after im contacted by support :  
"
1709,"tried to write a blog multiple times however the app would constantly crash on me twice i even lost over 2 hours of work such a shame :  
"
1710,"cannot upload my articles gives me an error every single time cant add categories or a feature picture :  
"
1711,"it doesnt support right to left writing and hasnt proxy setting :  
"
1712,"i liked it at first but it wasnt syncing to any of my devices so its completely pointless i ended up having to copy and paste all of the long text that i wrote out into a word document at one point i noticed that the text in my draft was gone i hit the back button to get off that page and the wordpress ap saved my blog as that i would have lost everything if i hadnt had a page open on my laptop where i was editing that page and could just hit publish on there to repopulate the page with my text scary :  
"
1713,"i write my blog on my laptop done my update when i found out the one in my phone isnt updated so i tried to refresh it it ended up upload the old one and replace the new one i edited with my laptop i had to write all over again wasting my life :  
"
1714,"i love this app because i can write anywhere and anytime but when i edited my drafts on wordpress website it couldnt link with my wordpress app so i lost my script that i wrote on website so annoying i think :  
"
1715,"you cannot add captions to pictures created in an offline blog entry after the current update i cannot upload any pictures there is never a specific error message so you cannot know what is not working :  
"
1716,"pretty weak ui better dont use formatting responsive design does not work app constantly switches to browser i have closed my account :  
"
1717,"no matter a post with our without a picture i just get generic error i badly need an app like this and having it on my phone holding all my content and not posting is just mean :  
"
1718,"this app is absolutely awful i was hoping to use it for making websites but its just terrible im using the browser instead now because the app is just terrible i wouldnt recommend this app to anyone rather go and use the browser for wordpress instead :  
"
1719,"inferior in every possible way to using the online editor this app doesnt allow you to link to your own earlier posts crashes often can sometimes delet your whole draft even unsave a previously update and saved page and has issues previewing images it also cannot pull the most recent version of you updates which you created with the web editor woe be unto you if you mak long pots because after a certain size copypaste stop working and the editor gets so slow you have to wait for the displayed text to catch up to you what it does do well is present your stats page manage the site permissions and let you get a rough draft started though it has so many problems im just using the ms office apps for my rough drafts and then copypasting into the web interface ill probably uninstall this soon because it is basically horrible :  
"
1720,"hi developers i wanted to email you to ask a couple questions before i downloaded the app however when i emailed the address listed on your google play page i got an automatic reply that said i was using an outofdate version of the app i had not yet installed the app and was just trying to send an email to you it seems like the email address listed on your google play contact section should be a valid email address ive now installed the app but still did have a question :  
"
1721,"doesnt work unless i grant google services access to telephony why is that :  
"
1722,"nice but the editor should have a texthtml option of input like in the desktop interface paragraph indents are becoming difficult to achieve and are important for constructing poetry :  
"
1723,"when i go to sites i follow i have to scroll through each days comments from the 1st one to get to the latest comment so to get to the end 900 comments need to be scrolled through there is no date first last next oage or comment number links :

"
1733,"it worked before but now i cant log in anymore it keeps turning back asking me for my email and password please fix this edit the problem had disappeared i dont know what happened maybe it was a network failure since im living in a restricted country but if the app told me what was wrong then it should be much easier rated 5 stars :  
"
1734,"formatting is lost each time i exit post view after editing upon returning to the post it appears as one solid block of text with all styling removed issues with grammarlys inline word correction appearing as a question mark icon in the wordpress mobile post editor update the formatting problem occurs when using the gutenberg editor on a computer then editing the same post on mobile it seems the content blocks dont translate well to the mobile editor :  
"
1735,"why cant i paste text into a post it makes 90 of my task really difficult this app should be able to do something this basic :  
"
1736,"deleted all the reviews and after long experience with wordpress i can strongly prove that wordpress is gateway of hackers coin mines viruses etc etc also careless and ignoring after lots of complaints :  
"
1737,"i can draft and edit blog posts and pages generally it works fine but it has gagged once or twice when im posting too many pictures when it gags i end up having to load pictures on a computer :

"
1745,"everything seems to work except adding photos which is what i need it for so thats bumming :  
"
1746,"would be good if you could fix the sharing from youtube to a new post it removes the link from youtube on saveso the video is not embedded :  
"
1747,"as soon as i am trying to edit a post the app is showing an error and closing down please fix this asap :  
"
1748,"i hated this app i tring all accounts but they dont sign :  
"
1749,"great help for mobile need an undo button also it runs pretty slow and is slow to switch to when switching apps could use some optimization to speed up the startup and switching edit it still lacks a lot of functionality of the browser version for example easily linking an existing article on your website and id like more control over the font size etc in block quotes :  
"
1750,"i need help with my website i dont think that is the app problem but i dont know where else to ask i cant open or view my website i mean i can edit the blogs and sites but i cant view them ive tried to open my website in every browser but it doesnt work can aomebody please tell me whats wrong and the app is really great by the way :  
"
1751,"if a username has been used in the past even if the original owner isnt using it and they cant ever use it again it means that you can never use it either it just gets dumped into this endless pit of used usernames for no apparent reason i had this problem when i forgot that i had an older acct with a name i wanted so i went and changed that and was still unable to use it because of this also its hard to scroll when editting your blog post if you have pictures because attempting to scroll and accidentally touching a picture opens the picture options :  
"
1752,"really screwed it up by adding search at the top total mess was much better before the update now on my 62 inch screen everything is jumbled together and it looks like garbage so im going to uninstall it :  
"
1753,"i have mixed feelings ive installed and deleted it several times because i love it and then hate it but it does allow me to blog offline and so i reinstall it ive only lost hours of work once my review meh could be better but it serves one purpose reasonably well :  
"
1754,"trying to use the menu editor to add pages to a menu hierarchy sucks the page you create is at the bottom and you have to drag it up to where you want it trouble is when doing it on a mobile phone is just ends moving other pages too should be simpler to add a page to a specific location on a given menu :  
"
1755,"this wordpress app is amazing tho the latest version is kinda wrack i wonder why some of the posts i make arent showing up on my blog unless i post via the blog browser please help look into this also the app crashes :  
"
1756,"application is very good i would have gave it 5 stars if installed plug in like one signal is available on the mobile version when i post something and want to send a notification then the app is useless to me :  
"
1757,"showed a pop up saying publish with confidence chose publish now app crashes nothing gets published or saved if you didnt add this feature my post would be published ive lost confidence :  
"
1758,"used to be great for sharing news and articles from various sources that seems to have stopped all that gets shared now is the headline without the link to the original articles not happy :  
"
1759,"the app fails to load updated posts that ive written on my computer i just lost my post because it failed to update it now i have to go rewrite it :  
"
1760,"not updated blogs in ages cant upload images app used to be great but for me its now unusable due to image upload failures :  
"
1761,"nowadays after posting a blog only the name remains and not the content in it what type of nonsense is this :  
"
1762,"i cannot publish articles on my blog using this app i get generic error message whenever i try to update my blog :  
"
1763,"generic error not able to post anything  :  
"
1764,"dora the explorer says no      :  
"
1765,"this app never works for me so frustrating :  
"
1766,"this app is nice but the problem is publishin docs :  
"
1767,"can ads start on this apps blogs :  
"
1768,"submit                         :  
"
1769,"why lack                       :  
"
1770,"i cant even get into the app   :  
"
1771,"i found a major problem with the app i was writing a draft on the app and saved it to work on it later in the day when i got to the office i continued with my article and went on to publish it however when i opened up my app after this it reverted my article to the last version that was worked on the app this annoyed me greatly as the article was retracted from being published and reverted all the work ive done i had to reinstate the article to the latest version on desktop but such things should not be happening the app should not operate separately from the cms because whats the point really if i cant seamlessly switch between desktop and mobile i wont be using the app until this gets fixed :  
"
1772,"i think we need discard local changes button when i open an article only to view it then close it again it is marked as local changes though i dont edit anything and when you editing from pc the app just wont fetch the updates from pc because it is marked as local changes :  
"
1773,"an entire blog post deleted thankfully i managed to get my blog post back through the website by checking the revisions also the app crashes a lot almost every time when im writing a post :  
"
1774,"very unsure about this app i wanted it so that i could write offline on my tablet which seemed to be working just fine however a couple of nights ago i added a huge amount of content to a particular post using my pc online and when i went to update the app once it was connected to the internet instead of updating the app with the latest information it updated the blog with the last things i did offline this doesnt seem to make any sense and i cant find instructions on how to use it so that i dont lose work :  
"
1775,"i use this app for my blogs personal and academic but the app always crashes especially when i try to create a post good thing theres autosave but its still better if i dont have to suffer about crashing 10 times just to do my college requirement im not exaggerating :  
"
1776,"l tfen y netim panelini burdan y netebilece imiz bir g ncelleme getirin we want admin panel please :  
"
1777,"there needs to be a better way to switch in between accounts because currently the application cannot remember the accounts :  
"
1778,"is always closed after a few minutes writing :  
"
1779,"mantap djiwa                   :  
"
1780,"couldnt log in with my google account i received an error saying there was some trouble connecting with the google account i dont have this trouble on my laptop im uninstalling the app :  
"
1781,"danger if you have existing sites local drafts on phone do not update to this version else you loose all your hardwork if start from new phone is ok :  
"
1782,"can you somehow add search bar to blog post field its annoying to scroll down so deep when i wanna edit past posts that have been published so long time ago :  
"
1783,"does anyone else have trouble uploading now :  
"
1784,"cant write contiuesly getting hang on 4gb ram :  
"
1785,"ive been waiting for this update for long long time to be very honest enough cause it now allows you to add h1 and h2 tags in it which is good for seo however it the blog post is integrated with yoast support then publishing articles with be super fun via mobile at this point of time im restricted and depended on my laptop cause it wont effect my seo ranking which this mobile app is lacking hence i cant publish article using this app normally i use it for just stats if they give yoast support then it would be easy to use this app :  
"
1786,"i have a wordpress account i have had it for years i just found out the wordpress had an app and i thought oh okay awesome i can do my posting from my phone no i entered in both the email i have with wordpress and the site and it said there was no match strange considering i was just on my website this morning please fix whatever issue this is because i would like to use this app due to its convenience :  
"
1787,"too many bugs the text i type is often duplicated the app crushes from time to time and eventually doesnt save what was written maybe payed account works better i dont know but since i am not looking for that right now i think ill go back to blogger :  
"
1788,"perhaps one of the best places to write a blog however the curated discover section is dry and utterly uninspiring there were the days when discover was called something else and the readers would receive some of the best pieces of writing on the web very disappointed :  
"
1789,"pages created in this apps dont upload to the site different pages on apps and on online wordpress site the problem solved by reinstall the apps now it shown 2 sites of the same domain one is the correct online site :  
"
1790,"app lacks quite a few features but biggest drawback is inability to edit long posts app just eventually crashes before that slows down dramatically unconvincing and disappointing :  
"
1791,"i cant edit my posts atm i click the edit button in the app the screen goes white and it takes me back to the menu page please fix asap as i can now only update using a browser which is a bit cumbersome :  
"
1792,"wordpress does not care at all about its free users you have to be a paid user to even access their support features why do i have to pay to send you an email asking for help with your website i have not been unable to log in for days on the desktop version it just takes me to a blank page and i cant even talk to the people on the community forums because you need to log in to post so basically i have no way of informing them of this issue while the issue is happening i cant customize my blog theme or make posts or do anything but read other blogs posts because half of wordpress just looks like a blank page of nothingness ive been using wordpress since 2010 for various blogs but this issue is one i do not see ever being fixed so this is it for me all i can say is thank god i never forked over 80 for a blog theme :  
"
1793,"the app keeps logging me out of my wordpress account when i log in im told ive attempted to log in too many times and i get locked out :  
"
1794,"updations killed it the functions are mysterious tough to understand it almost killed my site :  
"
1795,"cant login to my blog pls help i tried email address as well as my blog name but still its saying no match found :  
"
1796,"the stats are not showing up everytime ive to click on setup jetpack though i have plugin installed on my wordpress site :  
"
1797,"it hangs all the time and that just sucks :  
"
1798,"it would be so slow to write when the characters are quite much :  
"
1799,"visit website as an admin not working well :  
"
1800,"no email received from you that means no post :  
"
1801,"why i cant edit font size      :  
"
1802,"this app is hard t navigate i do not recommend this :  
"
1803,"sss                            :  
"
1804,"hate to be mean but unusable as is traveling and blogging for family is miserable a handful of bugs makes it unusable especially with limited bandwidth image uploads are parallel crippling performance and aborting every time you open your page for minor edits all images are downloaded again except they dont because they time out but still suck up your data plan and battery cant edit text while images are loading as each load resets focus want an unsaveable page just use undo after uploading images hours of cursing with this and the trip is only half way :  
"
1805,"just switched to android from the apple equivalent and am very disappointed i cant see the majority of my posts there are no categories im so annoyed i havent dug in past that point :  
"
1806,"everything is fine and good and perfect but one things that is i am unable to upload picture in my post it always fails if this fix everything is perfect hope to get ur response asap thanks :  
"
1807,"it keeps crashing after writing two sentences the app was fine until the latest release :  
"
1808,"this app is near useless it doesnt sync posts status properly it doesnt sync comments at all :  
"
1809,"no proper sync function just overwrites whatever is on the remote server with no option to rollback or discard local changes :  
"
1810,"is very useful but i have a problem when im trying upload image its giving me an error but when i do on wordpress dashboard its work great :  
"
1811,"i cant sync the blog post and i cant upload any news items nor upload pic please check previous version works for me :  
"
1812,"kita bisa share apa yang kita tulis dan kalau ada yang follow otomatis postingan kita bakal kekirim ke email yang follow kita sukaaaa :  
"
1813,"why this dont show post categories while editing a post :  
"
1814,"always been a great app doesnt seem to accommodate woocomerce plug in :  
"
1815,"takes too long to upload files :  
"
1816,"free web doesnt have freede    :  
"
1817,"its great but cant upload audio files need to fix that :  
"
1818,"i cant edit or publish anything on websitealways it shows errors :  
"
1819,"horrible app it is always crashing and losing work right before it crashes it starts automeshing words together worst of all the changes made to drafts on this app dont carry over to desktop twice i lost 500 or so words because i typed them via the app when i accessed my draft on desktop the draft opened without my changes and then autosaved you are better off logging in via your mobile browser :  
"
1820,"it would be nice to see the pictures when editing a post each time when i edit a post i can only see the link of the pictures which is not useful when you want to comment them all the rest of the app is very well made apart this im still waiting for this upgrade before using it update finally they made it i have installed this app many times and each time id expect to sea the pictures when editing last time i hope might be more than a year ago and now its working cool thanks wordpress next expectation searching a post ive got a 1000 of them and would like to check again all the content ive written from the beginning but it seems that i have to slide down the page for ever to be able to reach my first post am i mistaken :  
"
1821,"problems 1it takes about 23 minutes for uploading a picture like screenshot 2 shows generic errors while uploading posts 3automatically goes to top of the page when we copy paste any text :  
"
1822,"media could not be refreshed still and now i cant paste not using swiftkey not using the default samsung keyboard wp used to be great but it seems like every update makes it worse not better i dont need new features i need an app that has its basic functionality :  
"
1823,"its so hard to navigate its so irritating i cant even get past the customization phase of my site i dont know how to organize the menus and pages and it barely helps in providing me the necessary information to better navigate my site :  
"
1824,"the font settings are such a hassle apps should make our work easier but here it is easier to work on the laptop what with the annoying popups you should work on that :  
"
1825,"great app for blogging workflow on mobile however it doesnt seem to be possible to access draft blog posts why is this option missing update after connecting with support i now understand that all blog posts are inline in one stream drafts scheduled etc are there just sorted by date it would be nice to have a menu in the header to sort them by the kind of post though that might add complexity thanks to automatic for the quick response and support :  
"
1826,"i receive 403 error xmlrcp endpoint xml rcp is enabled and setting reading dont have option to allow remote publishing in world present on win7 and wordpress is up to date :  
"
1827,"the interface is a bit overly technical and dense even impeding in some ways with seemingly little support for the no cost accounts that are still used by wp to monetize that content :  
"
1828,"useless app using a browser is way better unfollowed default blogs and still keeps appearing on my feed had to block them :  
"
1829,"awful does its own thing ruined my site :  
"
1830,"worst appcant able to upload photo tried many time every time says upload failed :  
"
1831,"unusable unable to edit anything keep saying fail to retrieve site info :  
"
1832,"my old account open here or not :  
"
1833,"i dont know it seems good      :  
"
1834,"super app                      :  
"
1835,"yet to work on it              :  
"
1836,"formatting is a nightmare it changes formatting without you doing a thing paragraph spacing etc also no discard changes and limited undo while you are still using a draft :  
"
1837,"currently has poor performance typing lags significantly behind your keypresses and takes several seconds to show changes from predictive text as soon as you try to edit a post of any reasonable length usable only for the most trivial of work on a blog stick to the website for real work :  
"
1838,"i like the app but am constantly finding new glitches one of the worst ones is that one of my followers cannot comment she has tried numerous times but it does t come through the sad thing is its only on my blog her comments go through on other blogs :  
"
1839,"i wish when i read the article the page would be pretty like how my laptop sees it i like the photos on top with the title but on the android it didnt look like that not a big issue but not as visually appealing as laptop view :  
"
1840,"wordpress is great however this app wont connect to my selfhosted wordpress installation ive tried setting my wordpress domain to the site the logon page etc nothing works :  
"
1841,"shittiest application doesnt even match up to expectations even with an upgrade lags a lot and often restarts uselessly less modication tools on a free domainapp developers should honestly learn how to upgrade and make best out of limited resources :  
"
1842,"when you try to post texts it posts them multiple times you have to go in and delete the duplicate texts one by one very frustrating :  
"
1843,"i never thought that such issus on wordpress app will be appear on my device every time when i try to post new postpage on both self hosted and wordpress powered blog it says failed to publish post but actually it gets publish i have to check manually visiting my blog either it got published or not sometime my blog gets publish twice or third time while trying to repost i think it is jetpack plugin related issue it is really unfavorable update for me :  
"
1844,"a completely dysfunctional app that lacks direction or help files :  
"
1845,"i try to add more page but it doesnt added :  
"
1846,"no longer works wont upload media :  
"
1847,"                               :  
"
1848,"                               :  
"
1849,"only useful if you do the most rudimentary tasks on my first test i ended up giving up and just logging directly into wordpress admin via a web browser photo uploads fail 50 of the time and the message generic error is a useless for troubleshooting worse the app is so basic you cant access all of your post settings very disappointing :  
"
1850,"good web interface but the android adaptation in the app is very bad its a great deal of difficulty to format the post the formatting done in the post edit page is not retained when the post is published enters and paragraph breaks are ignored and all the content is published as if in one line paragraph indent is not consistently implemented only way to write a proper post is to use the web interface that too we have to write the whole post in the interface copying and pasting will again have same formatting errors :  
"
1851,"its a good all to easily update or create idea in post or page managing is a bit tricky so i firstly use it as app for the blog i got a bug when modify the heading of sentence the size become different even for same heading base on where you click what was the size before i need to load the page again to fix size :  
"
1852,"the biggest issue i have with this app is that when i try to write a draft on my phone and then press the sync button it automatically publishes it to my blog and send it out to my subscribers to me that is not what the word sync means rather i would have interpreted that to mean syncing my draft updates to match the draft updates that i have saved on line if i want to publish something i want to hit a publish button that is very clear about uploading the final product to the site i dont want to be taken by surprise when a substandard draft is on display for everyone to read :  
"
1853,"the app and the website dont work in sync with each other ive got posts deleted and modfied cause i saved a draft on the app then finished the post on the website and then re opened the app to find the blog rolled back to the draft it is a huge pain to use the app this way would rather prefer a consistent website instead thanks but no thanks  :  
"
1854,"i should be able to write in the app not have it lead me to a web browser where the app then freezes very frustrating :  
"
1855,"this app has one very annoying feature if you start writing a post draft with it the publish time for the post will be when the draft is first saved and not when the post is actually posted lets say i start a draft today using the wordpress app then a week from now i finish up the draft but now im writing in firefox on my selfhosted wordpress instance the publish on shown on the post will be the date when the draft was first saved using the app and not immediately like it would have been if id created the draft in firefox instead of the app long story short the publish on value should be immediately unless something else is explicitly configured regardless of if the draft was created in firefox or using the app :  
"
1856,"overall wordpress left me with a regret that my time would have been better wasted had i gone for another cms provider the quality of the customers experience is absolutely deplorable :  
"
1857,"its all good but the only problem is while i try to select feature image it doesnt work i click on a particular image and it uploads a different one almost every time :  
"
1858,"app is not good music bloggers cant use this app because you can not upload audio very bad :  
"
1859,"doesnt have a sign out function to achieve that youll need to uninstall and reinstall just an update on 42818 still requires uninstall and reinstall great stuff :

1868,"a friend told me he could only scroll back to mid 2017 on my blog using the app i figured it was his phone so i installed the app i couldnt scroll further back than mid 2017 either so i asked another friend online who i knew used the app to check he couldnt get past mid 2017 either this app isnt good enough if the visitor has to go to my website and using a browser use the archive widget on my blog if there is a setting that all 3 of us have overlooked id be very glad to know what that is otherwise ill just recommend the regular dot com site using a browser update april 18 2018 the developers got back to me and informed me that the app can only handle the latest 300 posts so 300 posts and that is it since i write over 300 posts a year well that wont cut it for my followers the good thing at least now i know why my friends couldnt browse my whole archive on the app i appreciate the team letting me know :

"
1877,"this app looks like it is incomplete in particular if a page or a post have local updates they cannot be discarded and might overwrite recent updates made from the site moreover customizing a theme sends to the site really :  
"
1878,"overall an excellent mobile app including most of the desktop features im just missing one really easy one justification for text and there is a minor issue concerning the updates of the archives which always causes my phone not to synchronise properly when i finished an article on the computer saying local draft instead 5 if you get that fixed thanks :

1894,"i am really annoyed right now with what just happened i typed an entire poem of about 810 stanzas on the spot and i had to pause my work for some reason i updated the saved work and suddenly i see what a screen with only the first three lines of my first stanza now what can i do and what can you do to repay for my loss it was definitely one of those wordpress glitches and i am fuming right now i had to publish that post right away i have no backup nothing i need some response from your side otherwise i am deleting my blog :  
"
1895,"52218 update its a real pain when you copy text over and it has tons of formatting in it which is difficult and time consumer to remove and causes all sorts of other errors almost not even worth using anymore to create a post also blockquote does not seem to work anymore finally the app is heavy battery intensive using galaxy s7 edge seems to be a problem with a recent update :  
"
1896,"what i love about this app is that you can view your site statistics live and it has a nice widget for that but it requires that you have jetpack running on your website which is a huge slow down and super bummer the moment i unloaded jetpack my site speed increased exponentially but i could no longer use this app also there are several technical errors within this app when it comes to updating a post that has been initially done on a desktop computer also creating new posts is very limiting which youd expect on the mobile app but oftentimes requires a lot of fixing once you view it on desktop :  
"
1897,"still not getting notifications contacted automattic as requested but no response i also have to like posts at least 3 times before it takes original issue still not resolved the app has stopped sending notifications they are enabled but i never receive them if i go into the app on my own i can see the actions for which i should have been notified but im not notified i have to go in and check manually :  
"
1898,"this app has syncing problems i started a blog post on the app and then finished and published it on desktop version when i went back into the app the post was still a draft and whatever i wrote on the desktop version wasnt there it then synced and reversed the post back to draft with half of it missing i had to go to wp admin on desktop version to restore to the published post and republish it :  
"
1899,"its a great app except for mobile posting i always have to manually code the font colour please fix this i faced this hassle every time i posted from my phone :  
"
1900,"the only thing the app desperately needs is ability to upload media items other than imagevideo eg pdf you can insert pdf already in the library but you cant add it to the library :

1903,"i am having problems logging into specific sites when i try to view content it shows that i am unauthorized help :  
"
1904,"its useful to quickly do a short post and upload photosvideos from your phone to the midea collection though it fails when you write two paragraphs the app just closes usually i can reopen the app and the two paragraphs are still there automatically saved in a draft its annoying for anything serious the code function went away with the latest update and now you cant put everything in a post unless you skip the app and open in a browser its useful to use for uploading from a mobile but not if the image is high quality you can trust the upload to fail over and over again only to have it say it got uploaded but then be unavailable to view the last couple updates killed the hope for this getting better please put back the option to use html rather than just the editor like i said the change in the update is the only problem except they did not fix the close out glitch yes it happens with this app on all my familys mobile devices please fix the random unexplained closing out of this app no the ram was not full yes i turned it off and then back on only happens with wordpress please fix in next update i gave four stars because its so useful for quick short stuff i didnt give fuve stars because of the close out glitch :

"
1922,"i have never noticed this problem before because i do most of my writing and editing on the easier betterlaidout legacy web interface since it is less bandwidthintensive than the newer ui the problem is that the app deletes two spaces after periods replacing them with one space now i have to go back to the computer and reinsert spaces for ease of readability only 1 bug in prior release that has bothered me cursor jumping around on edit screen this release has for some reason removed ability to upload images either via galleryshare or from new wp menu need to get this fixed right away :

1936,"this app worked very well prior to the last update but they had to go and play with it so that now it is a woefully painful piece of rubbish now my advise to the developers of wordpress is they need to stop messing around with it :  
"
1937,"this works just okay in most aspects but i realise it always screws up my scheduled posts i would schedule a timing for a completed post on my computer but this app will just revert the post to draft and not release it on the scheduled date im considering uninstalling this and just working on my blog through browser alone now :

2036,"as soon as you open this app it will upload its last version of your draft even if you have worked past that version on another device resulting in the erasing of progress made be warned i find this an incredible oversight why cant it recognise that over writing a newer version with the local older version is not something that should be default :

2070,"wordpress is great were still using it and its free so we cant complain but the app does have many many quirks which cause problems two of us edit our blog on different devices and posts go missing or fall out of date regularly i think it would work perfectly fine if you are a solo blogger once a month the app will need reinstalling as it gets stuck and will not fetch all new content from other editors we still think wordpress is great but the app quality itself is terrible :

"
2075,"i find it more intuitive than the website but there are definitely flaws primarily being that if i edit a schedueled post online the app doesnt synchronise and there is no way to manually do that that i know of uninstalling and reinstalling is the only way ive found :

2086,"i was super impressed with the app up until i went to edit a published post the app wasnt updated and showed my blog post as its first orginial draft all my edits and revisions since then are all gone it was considered a draft again and unpublished that was days and days of work disappeared within seconds i will no longer be using this app :  
"
2087,"good but missing custom post type support i add cpts into most of my sites and only being able to update blog entries is very limiting image handling is a bit buggy really good when fixing typos or creating quick posts the earlier versions of this app were way more functional :  
"
2088,"uploading media does not work properly some files do not upload and the app does not resume automatically which is annoying but even worse some files are uploaded several times if you try to reupload and then you end up with duplicates also if the app closes in the background it starts uploading all media of a post again there is also no source editing recently it just started crashing in the media library in summary the media upload is useless :  
"
2089,"what an app as a writer who puts in so much mental effort to produce posts the app cant even do its basic job a post i have been writing the whole day just disappeared why dont the drafts retain the recent updates its sickening i tell you especially if one has deadlines to keep :

2095,"oh where to start with wordpress as a computer science student at worcester state uni i very much enjoy working on the internet wordpress is the perfect platform for blogging or normal website design for personal or professional use i use it for all my blogging needs and it suffices completely i cant think of anything that id want more from the app but there is one feature id like to learn to usehave updated for easy implementation in wordpress links to donate small sums to the author of a pages posts and features to place specific sized ads in ones post to support wordpress itself :

"
2351,"it doesnt auto add your jetpack websites you have to manually add them into the list even though when you get a notice about that site you can access the info with that alert without adding the site not a very well thought out app :

"
2367,"these past few days i cant publish a post properly it always says error 404 something like that because of that i still open my phones browser to publish a post and id like to suggest that if writing a post can we have more editing options like text alignment and colours id love to have that one on the app  :  
"
2368,"well it started of well but now i am encountering new problems every single day the app is not user friendly kindly upgrade it i have already posted my queries to the contact group waiting for the problems to be fixed but this shouldnt happen i do request you to please make it an app worth using i just starting blogging and do not want to loose everything by deleting my account :  
"
2369,"love wordpress hate this app youre literally just better off using your browser to do everything adding a self hosted site is always a problem signing in :  
"
2370,"i deleted the app because i got fed up with the fact that i barely can do anything on the app anymore reinstalled it thinking there will be some changes but for me its worse i can even see my draft or go to my home page i cant do much its pointless having an app for wordpress :  
"
2371,"i thought it was good if a little hard to learn till i read you should use a child copy so updates dont overwrite your blog and you have to redo it that totally demotivated me trying to go through the steps to create and use a child copy was just too much for me to figure out at this time in my life :  
"
2372,"i used this on my phone all the time to work on my blog then suddenly it doesnt work properly ive uninstalled a shame because it was really good yesterday :  
"
2373,"the spacing on each line is too big and it makes your work look scattered its difficult to close the space this is an inconvenience :  
"
2374,"ich finde die app an sich nicht schlecht aber ich finde ich brauche keine app wenn ich eh immer an den computer muss um alles nachzuarbeiten weil ich am handy keine bilder bearbeiten kann man kann weder die gr e ver ndern noch kann man bilder zuschneiden noch kann man sie drehen eine andere eigenart ist n mlich dass die bilder manchmal einfach gedreht hochgeladen werden das bedeutet dass ich jedes mal extra an den computer muss um die bilder nachzuarbeiten was unglaublich l stig ist schade weil auf dem computer hat man sehr viele auswahlm glichkeiten f r einstellungen :  
"
2375,"thought it wasnt working so i have it a bag review but it turned out that one of my plugins was not allowing the app to connect to my site :  
"
2376,"lots of bugs with the editor my post went online with no tags and no categories and the app doesnt even let me try to fix it :  
"
2377,"nothing works its all cant be reached at this time i have 2 sites and it only displays 1 too many bugs keep working on it :  
"
2378,"i updated the app today and i am annoyed with it upon trying to customize it i was sent to a browser whats even the point of the app now :  
"
2379,"useless this not synchronize your post and dont work correctly :  
"
2380,"wont sync with the work i have done on computer :  
"
2381,"can anyone tell me is this the real app of world press and how can i connect this with goggle :  
"
2382,"works well would like to manage updates from this app but it does not do that :  
"
2383,"i cant upload pictures to my posts :  
"
2384,"posting blogs must have all the options i cant even have headings :  
"
2385,"cant edit my templates from the app :  
"
2386,"i cant post why cant i post its only on draft :  
"
2387,"cannot view post page comment  :  
"
2388,"editor is missing not even half the functionality as the one in the web browser you cant even add a heading or set the font size the only way to do it is by going to the html editor and add a tag that way the only good thing about this is being able to manage posts pages and comments move or remove them if you want to edit posts or page on your phone or tablet youre better to do it another one and copy paste it in using the web browser admin panel :  
"
2389,"absolute dog crap uploading pictures might as well take a century if they work at all the formatting gets completely messed up if you dont use html but i can never switch to html because the photo uploads which never finish block me from doing so app crashes every 5 minutes and has numerous glitches very very disappointed as i love the wordpress platform and was counting on this app for a blog i was doing while traveling but it did not work at all extremely unimpressed 15 would be 110 if i could give it such a rating :  
"
2390,"three things plague this app for me 1you cannot upload on the featured image button you have to do that on the main screen of the site 2you cannot get the edit post link through the app have to log into dashboard on a browser i need these links to submit post to my editor through slack or trello 3there is no word count visible i need that since the sites i write for have a minimum word count all three of these would make this a five star app for me else it is useless for me and i might as well just write through the browser :  
"
2391,"app spying on me when i click on an image from the attachment screen app says cannot load attachment but some ip in washington virginia immediately hits my site for the same image why :  
"
2392,"it never works for me i can log in and see the dashboard but whatever i tap on be it posts or stats or anything other than settings it tells me posts couldnt be refreshed at this time or stats couldnt be refreshed at this time etc and i literally cant do anything with it browser editing for me too i guess its a shame because it wouldve been much more convenient :  
"

"
2394,"does not work with several popular comment subscription plugins if a blog has comment moderation enabled and then an administrator replies to and thereby approves a comment which is pending moderation from within this app the comment author will never get the reply notification email this is because this app appears to somehow bypass the wp set comment status hook when administrators reply to a pending moderation comment within the app the wp set comment status hook is what fires the reply notification emails for many comment subscription plugins there is a clue that the developers know of this bug i do see it as a bug because in this app an administrator can reply to comment that is pending moderation but in the regular wp admin interface the button is labeled approve and reply not just reply i hope this gets fixed as it would be great to use this app to approve and reply to comments and fire the wp set comment status hook so that comment authors can receive email notification of the replies :

2414,"photo uploading is decidedly broken the multi picker works great but it is a coin toss whether each individual photo will upload successfully or hang at 80 and go nowhere the only way to fix hung uploads is to delete it and then browse through your photos again to try once more this is a huge burden when you upload 20 photos and 5 of them hang this behavior is consistent whether on wifi or data whats more the only intuitive options for a poat are local draft or publish i cant get the app to default to draft in which it is uploaded and able to be edited on my computer even if i only have the app as a way to upload cell photos it is almost worthless at that :

2509,"this app is so bright it hurts youre trying to read write and relax but the blank color scheme reminds me more of the sun hitting my face at 6am than of me relaxing while browsing this app doesnt have some sort of front page like imgur has for example instead all we get is the discover feature which only promotes bland vague and uninteresting posts with no personality just look at it right now where are the people sharing relatable stories or video game strategies or book or tv show reviews or something all the posts featured there are just unattractive to say the least and its the only source of new content there is otherwise you have to look it up manually there are no set categories or tags instead you make them up and unless people type them up exactly like you did they wont see your post which is counterintuitive and discourages finding new posts or bloggers people can disapprove or even edit your comments that is twisted discourages freedom of speech and opinion sharing and even allows people to literally put words in your mouth by changing your original comment to whatever they want you cant dislike posts or comments so the voting system is pointless you might think otherwise because twitter and vine have no downvotes but they promote discovery of new content in various ways while wordpress does not the search bar doesnt work ive tried finding my own posts with the exact same title they have and they dont appear all of these factors make it feel deserted and lacking of a community and discourage new users of getting into writing or reading on wordpress also there used to be a eay to add a black outline to images a necessity when the background is white :

"
2575,"thanks for the great appbut the last update is really buggy and crashes :  
"
2576,"ive had to update due to phone change very glichy typing is challenging constantly having to hold numbers down to get them to appear :

"
2581,"always failed on posting       :  
"
2582,"cant login                     :  
"
2583,"for the most part i enjoy managing my blog with the app alone there are some features unique to the web version which i definitely understand however with the latest update posts in the reader do not appear to be in chronological order with the blogs i follow and there doesnt seem to be a way to sort posts the first couple are recent then theres some from a week ago and then more recent good app overall but this feature is quite frustrating :  
"
2584,"terrible interface doesnt link online formatting missing soooo much saves automatically no undoendless list impossible to use :  
"
2585,"its good but i miss the admin options as well i miss those features when i post a post for instance when i hit post it puts all the post together published draft scheduled why cant it be separated and why cant i create gifs for a post that would be nice i should have the same features from admin as the app :  
"
2586,"the app was great in my old fone but when i installed it in the new device redmi3sprime i stopped getting notified from wordpress when somebody likes or replies to my comments i have checked with the notification settings n app settings n they are on i checked with the settings on my fone too yet im not getting any notifications what do i do  :

"
2588,"new review previously one star works great interface seems a little crowded but gets the job done and is a better experience than the mobile site cant get this to run very well if at all when on my sd card not sure if that is on the app or my phone reason for one star review before moving it to internal storage :  
"
2589,"i previously had an issue with inserting images and was asked to contact the support team however the problem seems to have fixed itself so im guessing it was an awful internet connection causing it not the app itself :  
"
2590,"its good and i mean in general not only the so but what is really the use of writing if no one is going to read comment or like it everyone wants to be on their own path and do not even want to compensate those that write with encouragement and they lose that zeal and courage to write thinking that nobody likes their posts :  
"
2591,"gives too much line spacing check my blog posts then click on sales contacts nationwide some paragraphs have normal single line spacing while other paragraphs have very very long line spacing :  
"
2592,"if i click a wp link on social media or on the web from my mobile browser why doesnt that link automatically open in the wp app in my mobile that would save my time to have to log in again on mobiles web browser when i am already logged in on my wp app :

"

"
2617,"on an older version i couldnt get the app to load at all since updating the app is getting better now the main issue is sometimes it fails to connect to the internet forcing me to use the browser instead of the app :

2622,"would you like to trust the certificate anyway i press yes but not working please fix this issue :  
"
2623,"compared to online even on mobile it lacks formatting features also its glitchy sometimes unclicking the number list feature erases the entire note and sometimes the quotes causes the formatting over any paragraph under it to go far right :  
"
2624,"recent updates render the app very frustrating copying in text is overriding the style sheets formatting all jacked up this app was very clean before the updates and i would joke with iphone users who had to use alternative ways to handle their blog like evernote etc now i am considering these alternatives because of the poor changes made in this update :  
"
2625,"a ctrlz or undo feature recycle bin for deleted posts ive had to retype my blog 4 times now because the app wiped it clean twice the third time i was copying half the story and it cleared it instead im now typing in google keep to avoid any further hours lost :

2634,"must have                      :  
"
2635,"does not allow you to login to a selfhosted site worse the forum moderators are not interested in solving this problem they merely cut off any comments about this problem work around delete the app access wordpress with a browser :  
"
2636,"the app was very useful until updated cant find drafts and also can not edit draft now the new feed is just in the mess instead of showing the lastest post from blogs that i follow like it used to now it wasnt sorted by time and make it hard to find new posts :  
"
2637,"now unable to add new posts via the app cant even log in to a self hosted site again if you log out keep getting error messages makes the app useless :  
"
2638,"no option to view the html editor makes things like embedding video from youtube impossible whats the point of an android app if i have to use a web browser to do some things anyway :  
"
2639,"reader layout changes aside which are annoying the reader itself is auto refreshing now but its also not showing posts like it should im seeing blog i follow not showing in my followed sites list but showing by tag please keep working to fix this :  
"
2640,"you should definitely install and use this if you want your site ruined beyond repair :  
"
2641,"useful app and nice interface the downside is lack of support for multiple accounts :  
"
2642,"it doesnt take any respond after writing user id and password :  
"

"
2650,"too slow                       :  
"
2651,"used to be a good app but it sucks big time now i cant upload images it always gives and error im going to uninstall this app this would have been very useful for creating a blog while being mobile :  
"
2652,"this app is flat awful and unusable for a blog with images first you have to insert a photo into a post to get it into your media library then you have to select the same photo to be the featured image but then the post will show the same photo twice so you have to delete the photo from the post and leave it as the featured image for the post to look normal and not retarded would be a million times better if you could select a featured image from local library :  
"
2653,"i am not sure what happened on thursday this app was amazing i used it to do work when i was on the road updating different things on the dashboard from my app no joke i loved this app i manage 5 sites through it i went to canada and came back to the states this morning and now i have to go through the internet to access the dashboard which means i have to log in every time too ugh this is terrible for someone like me who does web page admin on the go big fail wordpress :  
"
2654,"just blogged photos of all the new fabric i bought with sizes and it crashed and lost all measurements i also wish it wouldnt just save local draft as i had an issue with phone version and couldnt edit on laptop till i published it frustrated :  
"
2655,"i used to love this app but the latest update has removed the save button from the edit image screen meaning i can no longer add captions or image metadata a horrible oversight by the wordpress team :  
"
2656,"updated to 4 after excellent developer response will update to 5 after app updateoriginal reviewcan no longer edit offline with photos included in the latest version on my androids you must have an internet connection i compose most of my photo heavy entries in very remote areas with no internet and save the local draft until i can connect this change has made the program unusable for my purposes previous version was a 5 star product what a shame :  
"
2657,"needs more work the app also fails to load all followed posts unless you open it every few hours you can look forward to missing some of the posts that you would have liked to have seen i loaded my reader in the app and compared it with the browser version in 12 hours i lost 50 posts so useless if you only check once daily also needs better text formatting control :  
"
2658,"im using xiaomi redmi note 3 ever since i downloaded this application i cant log in it said something went wrong and i didnt know why when i checked the log it contained soo many codes which i didnt understand please fix it i really need this because im a blogger :  
"
2659,"when i post something it fails it is not even showing me my current posts which i have posted from computer no peer certificate error and by 3g it was uploaded :  
"
2660,"when i try to customize my theme it ask me to sign in and when i fill up the login details it just went back to asking me to login ive already change my pw for it might me wrong but still same results this is so frustrating :  
"
2661,"id love to see a few modifications operamini users complain of not being able to see my posts and also can the write logo become adjustable :  
"
2662,"update taking the suggestion from dev to use the support got response the help support close until september 22nd today is the 12th check the error myself maybe the xmlrpcphp install the suggested 5 year old plugin rename the file still cant check forum a lot of the same problem but no answer this is fresh installed wp i never had success with this app for self hosted wordpress two main problem to login to upload pictures always this problem i tried this app last year now the same problem still appear :  
"
2663,"checked user name and password several times even sat in front of pc and copied 3 times letter by letter reset password twice still unable to log in :  
"
2664,"for a long time in my previous blogs i couldnt write unless im on a computer well this app convinced me otherwise :  
"
2665,"it wasnt going well but after few chats with the support team everything went perfectly okay :  
"
2666,"went to create a blog post today using my wordpress app and discovered that the editor is some weird useless version of what it was before i cant do anything in it like i can in the web based editor such as indent center sizeplace images etcliterally every major function but basic typing is gone where did it go and how do i get it back if this is not fixed i am uninstalling the app as it is totally useless to me without the full version of the editor as well the web based editor crashes every single time i do an update to a blog makes editing virtually impossible i received an automated response to this review which said you can switch back to the apps old editor go to app settings in the app and toggle off the show visual editor option however some of the features you mentioned such as indenting or aligning text werent part of the old editor either found the setting that leaves only the html editor and does not fix the problemat all and previously before this change the editor in my app and the web based editor were identical in their features :  
"
2667,"really weak app literally lacks all features of wordpress aside from simple posting :  
"
2668,"hi i cant seem to log into the app or through the website ive tried several different devices android and ios im a contributor to a site and not the admin does this make a difference :  
"
2669,"so i updated the app yesterday and wish i hadnt was happy with the layout showing stats and view site together but now it has moved view site to bottom of screen and has a tab called plan which looks like a tool to sell your add ons :  
"
2670,"review update thanks for the feedback and solution i found the revision in wp admin and revert back to what ive post and update at pc this is a great feature to be able revert back to previous work my feedback maybe the word update button in the draft or post can be change to save or maybe we can have sync button to get the latest updated draft or post either in the web or in our phone before we start writing this app can check for the last modified date either in our phone and the one in the server right previous review update all update and published post that i work on pc was overwritten by this app click update i thought it will update what shown in my mobile phone as per what ive done at pc but it upload my draft that i have in my phone totally wasted my hour in front of computer uninstall it might thinking to change other website to start my blog :  
"
2671,"isnt this app used to connect to the backend too like managing updates and such what happened to that feature :  
"
2672,"after the recent update the font become weird and hard to edit :  
"
2673,"the update of this app was so bad to the extent that if i have to view my site i will be redirected to a web browser before i can view my web :  
"
2674,"drafts get deleted for no apparent reason save your writing elsewhere :  
"
2675,"though offline we can save the draft this attribute is the best anywhere anyplace idea struck jot it down without pen and paper :  
"
2676,"it would better if it gave you a list of links already created when u try and create a new hyperlinks to choose from rather than manually copying and pasting for every link :  
"
2677,"this is nice app but when we use in android insert read more tag not seen plz solve this issue :  
"
2678,"lately i find it difficult publishing my posts and the fault isnt from my network :  
"
2679,"help me for pic add center or html mode manual link wit image is not show :  
"
2680,"in order to subscribe or follow someone you have to make an account on the app you cant just subscribe like normal also it takes along time to upload photos :  
"
2681,"in the new version theres no read more icon anymore why i prefer the old version  :  
"
2682,"                               :  
"
2683,"all good but facing some problem with stats :

2686,"i would like to limit words and visitor should tap read more but that button is gone :  
"
2687,"it doesnt save my draft when i switch to another app my writing suddenly disappear :  
"
2688,"why i cant access to my account i can do it in my laptop :  
"
2689,"how do you allow comments on pages not just posts :  
"
2690,"even if i know my user name and password i cannot login :  
"
2691,"not get plugin in this app     :  
"
2692,"rp having somthing             :  
"
2693,"no comment                     :  
"
2694,"cant publish anything          :  
"
2695,"this app is not very good it worked on one of my devices for a little while but it doesnt let you login to external sites very easily even though im typing in the correct password and username and url i can still not login on the app but i can online needs fixed :  
"
2696,"i have so much trouble getting the spacing i want between sentences and paragraphs also sometimes i copy and paste and its nearly impossible to get the fonts right there is no built in font list please fix :  
"
2697,"i normally use my phone to write blogs and then suddenly after this update im not able to do a single thing properly its so disgusting the pictures wont upload and then suddenly after writing a whole post the article disappeared moreover after i uploaded my article i wanted to edit it but then it wont show up in the blog post section do something about it its getting difficult to write :  
"
2698,"this app is good only for viewing daily stats other wise its useless it cant upload pics and after writing whole blog it says sorry blog cant be uploaded please fix these errors otherwise i have to delete this app :  
"
2699,"but just barely every time you people update you screw something else up or you take away something we had before please do us a favor get out of the business stop pretending you know what youre doing find some programmers that care and you people can go flip burgers for a living ive had enough uninstalling and happy to be rid of you and the app that has become pretty much worthless thanks to you losers :  
"
2700,"often erases posts claims to have saved them but doesnt text will simply erase itself once it decides ive written enough with absolutely no way of recovering it no fake save message this time not sure how i could label this app as anything but useless :  
"
2701,"it was running fine all these years now i am unable to use it because it says cant upload the post no peer certificate such a disappointment any suggestions  :  
"
2702,"i cannot log in to my account to customize my theme ive changed my password 3 times because i thought its my mistake but no can log in on pc without problems only problem is with da app :  
"
2703,"i had this rated 5 stars but the app changed and now i cant find the more tag it really reduces my happiness with the app maybe ill have to move to blogger :  
"
2704,"i did write a review about the app crashing and looking my drafts the other week ive got a new updated phone and got the app theres some problems that are still in the app as in my old phone when wanting to add a picture from my phone gallery most pictures dont show up and they arent in order so its hard to find the ones i want sometimes when i click somewhere on a line or in a paragraph to type it selects the very beginning of the post or the very end and not where i click thanks :  
"
2705,"the view site feature was really the only feature i use in this app the view site that opens externally is pointless i dont need an app that launches another app i can launch chrome directly if thats what i need i know chrome renders better and everything but that is not an excuse to remove a feature app uninstalled :  
"
2706,"in some instances editing in webpage view mode as opposed to html will alter the code even if you dont change anything and immediately toggle to html making html the default view should be a workaround but as it is i have to save my script in a 3rd party app and repaste it in if i want to make any changes since my script is immediately ruined the instant it opens in webpage view which somewhat defeats the purpose of having a webpage editor in the first place :  
"
2707,"why would you take away the most useful feature of them all cant edit from dashboard now this app is almost useless without this feature unistalling :  
"
2708,"latest version has some kinks though when text is entered into the body of the text and the post updated either to be scheduled with all the other fields updated the body of the post is lost on being published :  
"
2709,"wordpress app for android is best app for mobile blogging great features and ui but the pictures upload made me feel sick you must upload pics one by one unlike the old version that let you upload pics and post with one tap :  
"
2710,"sadly cant log in anymore with self hosted site the ui is horrible please consider what medium are doing and follow their design :  
"
2711,"i used to use this app all the time havent for a while and decided to go back to it now i am unable to view the dashboard to enable me to update plugins etc on the go galaxy s6 :  
"
2712,"mostly great but cant customize themes in mobile when accessing the external admin portion appearance customize frontpage sections its impossible to open sections for slides and banners :  
"
2713,"disappointed that the view site and view admin inapp options were removed found that useful for previewing the site without contributing to my own visitor stats :  
"
2714,"extremely buggy the text editor is flawed and it should not be you know thats sort of important for a blogging app :  
"
2715,"good app the only thing is that i could do something one day and then not know how to do it the next sometimes the features can be confusing and hard to work with :  
"
2716,"the user interface is not as interactive as in other sites it makes blogging a bit boring the final outcome is good although :  
"
2717,"i have uninstalled and reinstalled it so many times it works fine the first time after that whenever i try to upload a post it says no peer certificate :  
"
2718,"this version failed to upload photos and publish edited post which i edited on my phone :  
"
2719,"how to log out in this its says disconnect from wordpress when i press on it its says you will loss all data in this device its a safe or unsafe :  
"
2720,"everytime i have to comment or like a post i have to log in and again and it redirects me to the browser version please fix this its really annoying :  
"
2721,"please give a separate between post was publish and local draftdraft because usually i create some post and save to local draft then i finish 2 or 3 post the post which didnt finished mixing with all post it should be good if add a separate thank you :  
"
2722,"didnt work first with selfhosted sites but apparently ubuntu xenial doesnt install phpxml by default while trusty did default lamp install to bad it doesnt do single sign on when you go to view the admin settings for example starts webbrowser :  
"
2723,"i hit backspace and it does enter moves to the next line i try to select text and the stupid magnifying box wont let me move the markers to the leftmost characters and what is with that double spacing i dont know guys but this app has become too much of a hassle to use :  
"
2724,"whenever it requires an update the app would always stop unless you install a uptodate version you ont be able to log in :  
"
2725,"whenever i add photo on phone app it will not work it always stopped after i chose photo why :

"
2750,"i spend hours making a blog post then the content will dissapear after saving or updating it also photos dont always upload but when it does work i love the app :  
"
2751,"in the latest update the choice for view my site has been removed i assume that this is an error but i would rather have it back since it allows users to inspect our blogs in real time which is a very useful blogging feature :

2826,"can you please fix or explain why the new post editor strips all the captions i have written for images update 27 contacted support team no response your editor is stripping html that was previously fine and does not even display captions anymore posting images is also extremely clunky and i am not sure how to get multiple images to appear side by side anymore the new version is a regression guess i will look for a new blog platform :  
"
2827,"whenever i publish using my phone app it fails to post and an error occurs please fix this so that it becomes easy to update through my phone and i dont have to open it on my desktop everytime i want to publish :  
"
2828,"the web version of wordpress doesnt share consistently pictures are taken from my file and applied to random articles without warning the mobile version is ten times worse writing on your cell is atrocious the text isnt consistent there are no color options pictures are shrunken and captions distort everything this app is a waste of space :  
"
2829,"please i cant find the page break function in this new update how do i insert page break please i need an urgent reply :  
"
2830,"warning dont use this app to write your posts safer to write them elsewhere and then copy paste and upload which essentially you could do using just the website so it renders the app pretty useless i have lost hours of work on a blog post all my text from the post disappeared not sure what i pressed then i pressed the back button on my tablet and the app saved my new blank post no option to restore a previous version as all my work was done offline as local draft not safe to work on this alone :  
"
2831,"i have tried to upload my posts and pics already for several times without any success it kills all the wish to keep up eith the blog :  
"
2832,"since the update some of my words are typed twice when i press the space bar on my keyboard it seems to happen at random but only happens in the wordpress app and only since the update this is very irritating as i cannot get through a sentence without having to edit my typing also itd be great if posts didnt automatically try to refresh and only show the most recent few when i open the app as it makes it a pain to go back to older posts as i have to redownload them taking too much time and using too much data :  
"
2833,"it now uploads media before you can edit things like post category and tags please let me done everything i need to for the post and then upload when and publish when im ready i now need to wait around instead of posting a photo and hitting go :  
"
2834,"i use this app very often its very useful but there are a few issues that i encounter the like button on a post never works for me theres no problem liking a comment or even posting a comment but the like button on a post is a big issue how do i rectify it :  
"
2835,"i can do most things i can on the desktop version and even check my websites stats through the widget only thing is that im from an area with really slow internet and i wish the app was more compatible with that :

2836,"i love the app and use it all the time to tell about my familys travels latest update broke the ability to write in hebrew all the text is lefttoright pressing html fixes that temporarily but i cant use the rich text option with hebrew please please fix this :

"
2840,"read more button lost clip tray option not showing when copy pasting items this causes loss in productivity and posting stuff is very time consuming now plz revert to previous update or make changes in the current app :  
"
2841,"it would be worth 99 cents for an app that works this one does totally unable to upload media why not build that feature in rather than just having the app sit and spin :

"
2889,"it wont sign me in likely because i renamed wpadmin because i didnt want it to be so obvious that i was using wordpress as a cms however the app should account for that and allow me to specify my admin panel pathing 010 :

2904,"                               :  
"
2905,"though i dont use wordpress mobile for penning new blogs it is great way to read blogs and keep a check on the updates in my blogs i have to say that the application has improved over the time and i can hardly find any fault with the app :  
"
2906,"really not happy just typed out a post and scheduled it its now vanished and i cant get it back also instead of giving us useless features why not allow us to have multiple accounts set up its the one feature majority of users need with apps like wordpress being used for business as well as personal blogs surely this feature should be essential :  
"
2907,"i have issue with log inlog out every time i open the app it says that i have entered wrong username and password and asks me to log in again and sometimes it is showing error and doesnt let me to log in for 20 mins it is so annoying i cant track my website in time 3 stars until its fixed :

"
2914,"cant login to self hosted site :  
"
2915,"it will not update my stats or view my posts :  
"
2916,"i erased and image and it literally cleared all i have written and there is no undo button sometime when i click on bold and italics and write something when i unclick both of them the italics leave the written word and leaves just only the bold ps you need to add a copy link of post button and an undo button i also realise it cant upload most images that are a bit large then it says errorsometimes the bold button keeps activating itself after deactivating :  
"
2917,"as a way of putting together posts on a phone this is a great app to have it doesnt handle intermittent internet connections well at all though the handling for syncing especially images needs work ive lost work a few times due to this at the moment its best to put in placeholder text for images while working on a post and then later putting in all images when you have a stable net connection :  
"
2918,"every post i write is accompanied with extra hours of redos redrafts and rewriting as the site seems to pick and choose what to keep when you hit save draft the application never ever works without several bugs to work around uninstalling logging out force stopping nothing works cant wait to switch to squarespace :  
"
2919,"on the whole this is an easy app to use and creates a nice clean blog using the default chateau template however it doesnt seem to want to let me add pictures from my android phone gallery if there is a way to do it it must be rather convoluted and byzantine because nothing i have tried seems to work i can do it from my laptop but not from my galaxy s6 edge plus edit just found a way to add photos but still cannot do it while im writing the post i have to add to the media library before i start the post :  
"
2920,"i was working with a beta version which started to lag and hang when i removed the beta this problem was tackled but since a couple of weeks the app has started lagging hanging and crashing again i am very unhappy about this as i am now unable to use an app that worked very well :  
"
2921,"i have followed the help suggestions no joy even at reduced size my image upload crashes my phoneits so frustrating all other apps upload images without problems :  
"
2922,"comments dont load anymore not sure if wordpress update broke it or app update broke it have 5 wordpress self hosted sites no comments load please fix this comments still broken cant add multiple self hosted anymore after adding 1 all others say error almost everything is breaking for self hosted wordpress sites with this app hope it gets fixed used to be great app :  
"
2923,"i hope you wordpress guys read this because this is getting horrible writing an article is ok although a bit limited but once you press the pubish button havoc begins first my samsung galaxy note completely locks up then apparently it cannot handle the stress anymore and just reboots and this happens every time i post something more than a oneliner with an image more then one image difficult video impossible i upload only via wifi please debug this thing or crate something that works :  
"
2924,"it takes several tries to publish the majority of attempts result in a soft boot it also loses the draft that is supposedly saved rewrites of the same post over and over is lame this is all on a nexus 6p with the latest marshmallow :  
"

"
3021,"i couldnt get it to upload media at first but i narrowed down the problem its not file size but dimension everything below 2 000 pixels uploads fine i havent tested anything larger just posting this in case you had the same problem use an image resizer app :  
"
3022,"i love wordpress but the mobile app truly sucks its so difficult to use and very limitedbon what you can do cant figure out how to change password how to search for bloggers or how to physically post something after ive written it would rather use desktop version of wordpress and just use the app to check stats :  
"
3023,"im unable to update my self hosted wordpress website from mobile because select media button is not working same problem was in previous release after update i thought that it might be resolved but no improvement when i install app for first time everything was good and working so i suggest same to my clients but no solution after updates 3 times yet :  
"
3024,"this ap lets you keep tabs on your blog stats traffic and comments pretty decently you can change your post status which i have found helpful at times only real problem ive had is trying to edit previously published blogs doesnt seem to like anything but plain text and i lose content and readability when trying to make even minor corrections to posts with pictures bolding etc :  
"
3025,"id consider myself a fairly light user just want to do text and pics with captions on my phone as i have no pc access adding the pics is a nightmare ive lately been using the multiple picker but it doesnt recognise albums and its very clumsy to scroll through thousands of pics have a workaround for that but then changing btw apps or just scrolling up and down in editing mode results in a crash sooner or later at my wits ends i refuse to add pics one by one in the media library :  
"
3026,"nice app for writing blog posts on the go checking out stats catching up on the reader havent tried adding artwork a somewhat annoying bug my views of my own blog from the app get counted in stats :

"
3031,"very slow and poor app makes the phone heat and drains battery like while playing a high graphics game wordpress runs better and faster on a browser :  
"
3032,"how people rate this app so highly is beyond me this is simply one of the most awful apps out there the interface is muddled and feels like an alpha going to admin is just a browser window that doesnt work as well as your browser it has quite possibly the worst editor ive ever seen youre better off just logging in with a browser than wasting your time on this this is a half baked broken app its a good thing they dont force android users to use the app like evernote does because this is atrocious just log in with your browser and use the web interface because its infinitely better than this :  
"
3033,"i loved this app but this morning it was just gone from my phone and ive tried about a million times to reinstall it but i receive error message 24 and i dont know why because it had been working just fine up until yesterday please assist :

"
3037,"works really well just gave it a quick spin and this latest update has it zoomping dont k know if it can facilitate the code customizing i enjoy on my site but it sure will power some real fly impromptu site administration even on my smallest handset :

"
3058,"i have had enough of my photos being moved around when i go out og the blog editor and then back into it it moves photos in the middle of sentences just went back into it after my phone battery ran out and the last three hours of editing a blog post was lost ive contact wordpress about this bug before and was told to update which ive done twice since and nothing has changed im moving to a different blog provider pathetic :

"
3068,"but i cant post from it why    :  
"
3069,"i really like this app because it allows me to edit posts when off line putting changes through when logged into a network however it seems to not keep in sync with work done on my desk top logged into my desk top or portable device will get me different results even though both should be synced that shouldnt matter rightof both devices go on line and are edited on the same account im pretty sure that ive been saving my changes anyhow thank you for this application i like the themes :  
"
3070,"awesome app very user friendly but i would like to be able to add featured images to posts thats the one thing i miss from the web version since my blog features an image in every post so i have to go back and edit any i write using this app :  
"
3071,"not much use very disappointing you log into your selfhosted site and none of the inapp functionality seems to work couldnt refresh at this time keeps being shown instead you need to view the website and then use the normal dashboard but on a small screen i could do that in any browser please fix the refresh issue :  
"
3072,"i downloaded this hoping it would be a good outlet for posting things i write unfortunately this app forces you to keep every line you write extremely short like 3 or 4 words before it bumps you to the next line i have more room on this review than i did on their app totally screws up rythem grammer pacing feel and sound bad app for writers :  
"
3073,"this app has used 750mb of mobile data in 10 days and i havent even used it very much and i usually use it on wifi anyway its a very nice app but there is something wrong with the data usage :  
"
3074,"i use the app frequently to write while i am traveling i just spent an hour to compose an article i needed to check a link on chrome and went back to the main menu it said local draft saved i looked up what i needed and went back into the app in the preview the pictures have been scrambled with the text an issue i had observed already which i did not really care about that much when i tried to edit it there was no more content everything gone except for the heading everything was deleted :  
"
3075,"after installing this app i had nothing but problems with my self hosted site wouldnt upload media in posts wouldnt log in properly err connection refused more times than i can remember leaving my site inn accessible for about 20 minutes i give up uninstalling go back to the computer :  
"
3076,"this app keeps deleting my drafts and i had to type the same stuff oover and over again it also deletes my pictures nonstop and i had to insert and insert until i get mad please fix this :  
"
3077,"the customization tool sucks i cant change the photo on my cover page and while it is a decent picture of snowy mountains i live in a desert so it doesnt make much sense i also cant change the font colorwhich is stupid since i can change the background and want to use a dark color to prevent eyestrain but i dont want to pay for the premium package ugh edit i am so sorry that it took so long to catch what my autocorrect did wow :  
"
3078,"this app is ok the end results can be great if you are patient but the whole interface is just painful and i end up putting off updating my blog because i know it is going to be a hassle there seem to be so many different areas to the app all of which allow you to edit a post for example but each with a slightly different interface and different features and options yesterday i was previewing a post found a mistake so clicked edit and went into a completely different editor which allowed media insertion direct from hard drive rather than having to upload to library first and now i cant find it could be great but is too messy and bitty typical piece of software written by a large company with lots of developers who dont talk to each other and no one person with an overview of what it is really like to use :  
"
3079,"app had serious issue i write my post and click on update button but lost all data because got error to update data app should save data into local before updating to server please fix this issue :

"
3266,"for me this is an important feature as i like to record where it is ive been traveling still buried and cant default to on slightly buried the new set up doesnt work with postcodes and wont let me view a map to confirm correct location why not use a small map and overlay crosshairs to allow confirmation or manual alteration :

"
3295,"almost didnt bother downloading based on a lot of negative reviews on here but im glad i did i could never use the browser on my phone to post because the formatting got all out of whack but it works great through the app also if i paste a poem it actually keeps the indents where i want them which i havent even gotten to work when posting via desktop computer :  
"

3301,"this used to be a really nice app until i got the latest update its slow loads very few posts on the reader and when it hangs while im using it other people cant access my site i simply hate and i advice you not to update your app if your still using the old version oh and another thing you cant view all your followers and the stats area is just complicated and useless they have also removed the widgets area :

"
3305,"i cant count how many times ive spent hours writing a post only to have it vanish just because i rotate to screen from vertical to horizontal why does the app refresh just because the orientation of my phone changes so sad that such a powerhouse such as wordpress puts their reputation on such a terrible app fix the orientation issue please :

3383,"i would love for the mobile app and the website to be more in sync que the boy band when i have done work from the app and then go to work on it on the site it doesnt even show up and going in the reverse is very difficult :  
"

"
3387,"i like word press but i have issues downloading free backgrounds also getting to my writings for editorial purposes is a challenge it gets stuck a great deal of the time when i have finished writing a piecethe starving artist :  
"
3388,"rubbish either i am missing something but where are all the advanced formating options if you want to write a new post i want to justify my text etc etc but all i get is this :  
"
3389,"the wordpress app does everything i want it too my only small gripe is that when im writing a post i would like some feature to be able to access my media so i can insert pictures into my posts other than uploading them every time :  
"
3390,"i can not repost from the follows i once was able to do in the old version so i am removing this app entirely i always told people not to upgrade because the upgrades have usually turned out to suck greatly not at all impressed over it :  
"
3391,"cannot load photos from the app if i do get lucky and get a photo on when i hit upload it just sits there uploading and i have to restart my tablet sometimes i cant even type on a post looking into other blogging services :  
"
3392,"every time i login to wordpress wordpress immediately logs me back out my password and username are correct so i am not understanding the problem please fix this :  
"
3393,"i love this app it gets a little buggy when writing a post on my phone but all the admin work is a dream one thing though ive stopped receiving push notifications this last week anyone else having this problem :  
"
3394,"ive been travelling and thought this would be an ideal tool to blog off line as i travelled dont try it i lost hours of work as any attempt to add to or edit your very first drafts results in large chunks of text being lost developers eventually admitted it was a bug but arent bothered enough to fix it before the next major version :  
"
3395,"guysno affect of the new updatesame stability issue with my phoneplease do find what is the issue for huawei g7i want to use the app but is f crashing my phone :

"
3397,"now i see why people cant long in it doesnt work for me either it always say we cant log you in :  
"
3398,"one of the major attractions this app has for me is the ability to write offline posts however two bugs make it completely unusable for that purpose first of all adding images offline and then reopening the post with an active internet connection removes all the images second if the internet connection fails during a post upload eg one with 30 images the whole upload hangs the app has to be force closed and then the upload restarted from scratch this has litteraly cost me hours of my time :  
"
3399,"please dont make me hate it first impression its good but so far so bad application says media server error okay but why losting my wrote damn its not once but its already for third time oooh man :

"
3404,"the only problem is when you publish a blog on your mobile device then attempt to open it on your computer all paragraphs are deleted apart from that helpful and easy to use :  
"
3405,"cant see anything on the page where you type your blog on the app with the keypad obscuring everything even when im not typing today which was also only the second time when i posted on my blog wp wouldnt let me reposition images inside the article after adding descriptions to them both on the app and the website and i had to add an additional note at the beginning of my article explaining the images compromising its structure im new to wp and intend to write more so please fix these asap :

"
3463,"im a little put off that this app is only a fraction of the experience you get on a mobile browser its not even a similar experience to the alreadyunnecessarilycomplicated one you get in wordpress rendering it unintuitive you cant even do basic things like set the feature image its almost insulting that theres a way to access the admin dashboard through the app which literally just opens the mobile wordpress in an inapp browser from there you can still access all wordpress features so why :

"
3496,"i rely on this app to communicate wordpress itself is great but the app will delete an entire post losing me hours of time and energy if i back out or answer a call while the post is loading it appears to do no cached versions so everything is lost it doesnt even do a you just said to save a blank post instead of the 1000 word 12 photo one you had is that on purpose i do save every once in a while but it doesnt matter with this issue it saves over back up your stuff on another app :

"
3657,"i just used this to perform a relatively simple task edit a post and upload some images the post editor showed all the markup for links formatting etc which looks messy and is hard to navigate worse still i wanted to upload more than one image which i wasnt given the option of i had to upload each one separately and refind the folder they were stored in each time which is time consuming and tedious the mobile website is flawed but much better than this so ill go back to that :  
"
3658,"every time i try to add a photo to my post it hangs my tablet making the screen completely unresponsive and randomly changes the screen orientation even though tablet hasnt moved only option is to reboot losing all work please fix update i uninstalled this version 39 and installed the one from the amazon appstore 38 i can now add images and find photos again not updating until i know everything is fixed :

"
3661,"i have multiple wordpress blogs and when it works its great but it consistently losses login info to one of my blogs so im constantly having to add it back and ive gotten no response about that from their support team ive now recently lost the ability to use the app after signing into an account since it keeps throwing me in a loop to sign back in i doubt ill have this issue long if its happening to more people but it seems they have consistent login issues they need to fix otherwise its great :  
"
3662,"am updating from rating from 15 to 35 wordpress has done a good job since the last time i used the app but still leaving out search which is one of the most important features keeps me from giving it 45 :  
"
3663,"it tries to load every single photo on the phone but barely displays thumbnails for any of them making the app useless need a way to select between photos and downloaded reference photos otherwise itll take forever even if the thumbnails worked very disappointed with this update ill be using the web browser to post until this broken app is fixed :  
"
3664,"i always write from the desktop but having an hour to kill decided to draft my next post using this app writing could be a serious and involving matter once done and seeing the full text on the screen i backed out to the post listing clicked on my draft and to my despair only saw first few paragraphs saved a rare free hour wasted now rewriting on the desktop :  
"
3665,"every time i want to view full site on my blog i need to put in my password even though i checked the remember this password box this never happened before the update :

"
3679,"im running version 381 and i really like the interface improved utility too the previous problem of retrieving stats on only one blog seems to be fixed occasionally i have to reenter login information on the 2 other blogs this seems to be a problem at the wp servers not with the app itself good app and getting better :  
"
3680,"it is handy for a lot of things but if i edit a post between my 3 different devices i never know when the changes will stick or if i need to copy and paste to and from a different cloud document app to ensure im working with the most recent revision kind of defeats the purpose of this app :  
"
3681,"i cant tell how good or bad this app is as it wont let me log in to my self hosted website it doesnt recognise my details but they work when i log in on a web browser im hoping it is better than the last version which had random error messages when i tried to refresh any page particularly the comments section :  
"
3682,"year after year the same crapi just spent 45 minutes working on a post i pushed the button to publish and wordpress immediately said it could not publish not sure why bc my internet connection is fine it didnt save the post the whole thing is gone up in smoke this app might be good for a buddhist who wants to work on not being attached to hisher posts but as far as a blogging app goes if it doesnt save your posts and loses your hard work then its crap dont bother :  
"
3683,"i use this app to blog while traveling i have had simple posts just text and photos upload as blank so many times which i finally realized is when i have too many photos now i try to cap at 10 or 15 no indication that something is wrong just waiting 30 minutes for an upload then finding out that it is blank no usable draft no way to get the content back other than to start over so incredibly frustrating also formatting is off when i try to edit on a desktop when ive saved a draft from app :  
"
3684,"great app i can put in posts save them as drafts and edit them later i do this during down times at work or when im away from my laptop great convenience id love an offline mode though unless i just havent found it yet :  
"
3685,"taking away the ability of css from the free users was a super bad move that will soon make the site fall as users will now move on to newer sites with better options a better idea would of been making the use of css limited that way you give a taste of customization to your patrons and theyll be more likely to purchase  :  
"
3686,"everytime i upload a picture it keeps disappearing its wasting my time to keep reuploading it fix it  :  
"

"
3858,"im unable to connect on my both devices i have to use vpn to make it work but i can access wordpress blog on browser without any problem :  
"
3859,"whatever you did in the update it screwed up a wonderful app i cant even get it to open now :  
"
3860,"great app for quick updates or edits on your blog when youre away from a computer but there are a few issues at least on my samsung galaxy tab pro editing pages or posts doesnt give you access to all features and if youre reading other blogs the comments section always says no comments yet even when you know there are comments :  
"
3861,"as others have said the functionality on this is less than youd get in the wordpress web page nevertheless it has all the main features and i use it all the time for posting blog entries when im not at my computer i find it quick and easy to use much quicker than trying to log into wordpress via mobile browser it may not be for you if you want detailed control over the look of the blog entries or if you use a lot of media overall flawed but easy to use and better than the alternatives :  
"
3862,"would be just what i need if there was any way of accessing the dashboard revised for newer version practically useless to me now gives no control over blog itself only very basic posting capabilities very sad as a couple of years ago this used to have full dashboard access so plugins and themes could be upgraded or installeduninstalled etc :  
"
3863,"it will upload small posts with no pictures in them but as soon as i attempt to upload a longer post with photos it starts a never ending upload which never actually finishes then when you go back into the app to see what is going on it deletes the post you were trying to upload and you are left with only the title and the knowledge that you have entirely wasted your time and need to write the whole thing and locate all the media files again totally frustrating it worked fine on ios :  
"
3864,"it was an excellent app for the functionality it offered allowed me to update my hosted blog away from home i loved the new dashboard feature it was quite flawless now its broken please fix  :  
"
3865,"almost always uploading a new post freezes sometimes it just means i have to restart and hope this time it works sometimes it means the entire post gets lost and i have to retype from scratch which is quite annoying to say the least on a phone better host your blog with a provider whose software actually works instead of destroying your data :  
"
3866,"working well for using reader to catch up on the blogs that i follow editing a post was frustrating as i couldnt undo what i accidentally deleted for comments i couldnt move freely from the post to and from the comment that i was writing nor could i copy and paste quotes from the post or other comments i was glad to discover that i must redesign my blog header to be compatible with smart phones :  
"
3867,"is it deliberate to just have reading functions only what happened to rich text formatting picture uploads feature image settings and easy post uploads i doubt this app would be on the apple itunes store with this rubbish fix up please :  
"
3868,"the app normally longer connects to my account since about a week ago initially it couldnt upload articles and then when i signed out to see if that helped i couldnt sign back in i hope this is fixed soon :  
"
3869,"when i schedule my post through the app for a future date it still post live in order to schedule a post i have to schedule it twice in order for it to work please help i tried restating my phone and im having the same problem thanks :  
"
3870,"i was able to post immediately with simple text updates immediately fine so far one star i was able to edit a post immediately and add a photo thats good too two stars my edits do not show not so good minus one star video cannot be added from my phone minus another star the message that tells me that leads to a nonmobileoptimized website for a videohostingupload site minus another star i would have paid for an app that would allow this but not an ongoing fee of us60 thanks not going to ding you for trying to make a living i dont blame you in the slightest just try not to make your sales pitch so obnoxious :  
"
3871,"hi i always cnt upload my pics onto my post page section i cant upload pics aftr i typed some words and i always have to upload first before typing but somtimes even uploading first also fails :  
"

"
3875,"wp works great on my computer and phone but sucks on my tablet the menu system jumps around when i tap on one item another is selected sometimes two menus will pop out and then i cant get rid of one the mobile menu lacks the same look and feel of the desktop version :  
"
3876,"the app keeps getting better but i cant have two blogs active at the same time why its annoying so please fix it  :  
"
3877,"this app is worthless its slow and the ux and ui are horribly restricted on top of that if you do anything without an internet connection it will save a local copy but if you at any point access your work and press save before its loaded the existing draft it will erase everything considering how much time ive spent writing posts that just disappeared id say this is one of the worst apps ive ever used :  
"
3878,"cant crop imagesunbelievably frustrating its also a little unresponsive to commands live preview doesnt work cant see all the themes etc :

"
3883,"please fix this cant upload images on post unable to upload media is always the response :  
"
3884,"i use this app to make a quick post and draft a longer post especially one with images most helpful feature for me is i can take a pic and press share via wordpress and then save it as a draft a suggestion support for multi blog login i manage two blogs and when i want to post to the other blogs i have to sign out and then sign in again :  
"
3885,"no issues fix your server if you have problems probably not the apps fault :

3964,"my full installed editor replaced with a limited functional one side menu slides around and hard to select something my post list is a long string of characters really shocked that this app made for wordpress does not beat my firefox browser on android slate hp pro 8 uninstalled :

3965,"best app can do almost everything that i can do by logging in wordpress from my pc only thing to improve is seo :  
"
3966,"one big complaint one cannot copy and paste a url into a message one has the use the google chrome and firefox browser apps for that  :

"
3975,"i tried to publised twice all gone it cant be seen on site itself :  
"
3976,"need a feature that we can select featured pic :  
"
3977,"this app is good for blog maintenance ie approving and replying to comments checking stats and making minor edits to posts however posts are in raw html which makes writing ones from scratch complicated especially if you want bullets indents captions etc the issue with this app is that the functions are all there but theyre sometimes hard to use :  
"
3978,"great app once you figure out which hoops to jump through to get the app to upload images successfully to the media library essentially you turn off preview and thumbnail and when you want to post you post as draft first then publish this little workaround should be on the help site in bold couldnt be happier now :  
"
3979,"the app doesnt seem to retrieve my posts over wifi i tried doing the same over cellular data and it worked for some reason disappointing :  
"
3980,"the app is a handy way for me to update posts and other information on my wordpress sites im currently using it to work with about 6 different sites and its ability to switch between them is very useful my two complaints are on the handling of images and other media in the editor and the handling of bullet points ul li also in the editor in the post display both appear fine but in the editor they appear as raw html while im comfortable with working with the raw html doing so in a mobile device is akward the process of switching entry screens to get to the key presses to enter an html tag is a pain unfortunately for me on at least one site both issues are common of the two the bullet issue is the higher priority if we could get a button for bulleted text like we already have for bold and italic that would help a lot :  
"
3981,"not so wp admin friendly inteface and no much added value compare to the web admin interface via browser takes age to quit the application :  
"
3982,"mostly a handy way to keep up with your blogs and add new material one request why do the comments continue to list all the spam comments forever once i have marked them as spam i dont want to see them can i filter seeing just approved or pending :  
"
3983,"update now instead of only sometimes getting upload errors with photos i get them every time app is totally useless now :  
"
3984,"i am having such a hard time navigating this app there are about 50 different settings pages and they are all for different things but not what i need i have read about 15 different how tos on how to use this app i cant find any of the pages that these how tos are referring to and if i actually do manage to find them they disappear next time i need them :  
"
3985,"does not save drafts i lost many times what i wrote not always connecting online and picture handling is terrible :  
"
3986,"i tried to schedule 3 posts today and they all get published immediately what a way to mess my blogging schedule i dont know why this is happening but im really really frustrated right now at one point there was a time when the app deleted a post that i saved and it was very long article i painstakingly wrote using a 7 inch tablet and you know whats sad i dont have an option but to still continue using it sigh :  
"
3987,"this app is fantastic update getting a cannot login message looking up in public forums for potential solutions and it seems like a problem for quite a few :  
"
3988,"used to work before the update now it cant handle uploading images change it back who cares if there is a new progress bar if it doesnt work :  
"
3989,"doesnt have visual text editor only html editor which is very clunky on mobile :  
"
3990,"comments marked as spam or those that are pending arent syncing correctly causing an error when trying to delete them which in turn leaves lots of pending comments on the app that cant be removed :  
"
3991,"its been twice now that i write a long blog upload photos and am either ready to post but need an internet connection or i am just not finished yet i will try to save and it looks like it has until i click the edit button to go back to it and suddenly its gone this is incredibly frustrating as i am traveling and only have a tablet to type these on and it takes some time i wont be writing another post through the app unless this is somehow fixed  :  
"
3992,"ive decides to write on my phone and guess what i had everything get lost twice on diferent ocassions ive written and lost everything i lost while it is being uploaded waste of time :

3993,"in a nutshell nothing works cant upload any posts or any photos to the gallery cant even save a draft post even with this new update utterly useless :  
"
3994,"loading too slow updates of posts late or sometimes doesnt i expected better :

"
4137,"very well built clean ui super simple to use and it just works so it has all the necessities the only thing id really love to see in the short term is for multi site support i manage multiple wordpress sites and every time i have to logout and back in i wish it saved the login profiles so i didnt have to constantly key in all the details or better yet just allowed me to change profiles ala how its done for gmail or drive that feature would save me a lot of time :

"
4140,"i published several websites based on wordpress and it is being really useful for my website i just think that it could have more things for example administration of users the biggest problem is that it doesnt manage more than one website :  
"
4141,"i wrote a long blog and tried to publish it and it got deleted how idk i refreshed i restarted my phone and logged out and back in again and poof i cant even find it in the trashed section soooo disapointed :  
"
4142,"i wouldnt write content on this mainly because id much rather type on a keyboard but for keeping up with comments its ideal be useful if comments manually marked as spam didnt show up in the comments list though :  
"
4143,"i love wordpress but this app is garbage ive lost several blogs already that i attempted to post just now i rewrote a blog twice and both times it just vanished when i uploaded it i get nothing but the title and an empty body i am fed up with it there are no backups zero record of the blog ever being there and when i log in on my laptop the draft pages look completely different seriously what is going on with this this app is useless dont download it unless you like being angry :  
"
4144,"seems like there are many directories to go through until it gets to desired action interface is bland make categories section titles easier to identify more popup text entry boxes would be great instead of scrolling so much :  
"
4145,"just this week my posts stopped refreshing i removed my selfhosted site and added it back but im still having the same issue been over a week and all ive gotten is one email asking what site i was trying to connect to no support no answers blocked access from my ip from too many failed login attempts needless and sorry to say the app is been uninstalled :  
"
4146,"for those with a self hosted blog after searching through wordpress i found that something was not enabled in my blog i think it was the ability to post via email and once that was fixed it was fine i still prefer to use a desktop but looking at stats and dealing with comments is fine :  
"
4147,"cant paste text into posts tells me to use ctrlv or cmdv doesnt exist for android oh and the response is crap because the suggested long press paste is when i get the crappy ctrlv message :  
"
4148,"the app is fast and simple i really loved it theres something that bothers me you cant see or edit the html code before you publish the post :  
"
4149,"actually its a good app but since yesterday i couldnt view my site from my phone even i want to refresh my page and post its always failed can you fix it :  
"

"
4153,"propper zooming on photos without the blue head banner filling the screen when zooming in will update this comment after using the app for a while july 4 still unresponsive and freezing :  
"
4154,"very frustrating in past versions i was able to work with addons such as jetpack this is just bare bones :  
"
4155,"comments are not sync please fix this i dont have any pending or spam comments but inside the app theres 36 comments :  
"
4156,"i tried adding the widget and nothing appears pointless :  
"
4157,"the app dont give full control to thw self hosted site and dont show the plugins installed and how to manage them and dont have functionality to show woocommerce or other shopping cart it ia must in any app that support such a big variation of events  :  
"
4158,"there have been several occasions where i have made a new post and it would not allow me to publish it or even save it as a draftthe buttons simply didnt work i couldnt even copy and paste what i had written so it was lost ill just use the desktop site thanks anyway :  
"
4159,"the app doesnt show any changes or new posts i make using the website until that gets fixed the app is pretty much useless for me :  
"
4160,"after the latest update the featured image tick box has disappeared how do you set them now using an lg g3 :  
"
4161,"overall a great app but the problem we get about an error when ever we upload media i given it 5 star because i love it but we need a better uploader to upload media files  :  
"
4162,"if you enjoy squinting at your screen while writing in order to distinguish you articles text from html code then youll love this app i must ask if evernote every other goofy little writing app can display bullets bold italic other formatting as i am writing why cant this tool for professional writers do the same i enjoy the wordpress writing experience on my pcbrowser because i can engage the content the formatting directly organically while im creating the only time i must face html is for the occasional media embed etc but with this app the html codes are scattered throughout the article act like irritating little jolts from speed bumps as the appear in the paragraph im working on so its impossible to get into a state of flow cmon developers you can do better than this i would gladly pay for a wysiwyg wordpress writing tool until then its back to my pc for writing editing my blog posts :  
"
4163,"just published a very long post and it uploaded a blank post and deleted everything id written not the first time this rotten app has deleted my work :

"
4167,"i just wrote a whole article the button for inserting images did not respond if i touched the outside of the text box i couldnt scroll back down to continue my article no scroll bar for text box when i went to preview the article it appeared as if it had posted it instead so i pressed the back button to get back and edit suddenly there was my home screen i went back to the app and everything was gone :  
"
4168,"keeps saying its downloading and nothing happens my internet connection is strong too :

"
4222,"i initially gave this app 5 stars but i have to settle for 3 stars after i used it ivehad some difficulties finding drafts of my posts i had to check my blog on a browser before i can edit my drafts again and publish them so that partwas kind of unnerving if that can be fixed then its back to 5 stars :  
"
4223,"i love it but there is something that wordpress had never improve i cant put the main photo on a post i manage a news media and its really important the main photo because i cant put the photo for the preview on the headlines from the app i have to go to the browser not liking that :  
"
4224,"i like the app it is easier for me to update or start a new posts from my phone what i dont like is the limitation to add images or videos in a specific part of the post unlike in the web version :  
"
4225,"will not upload images it says it has and when u go on the internet it just has the html strip :  
"
4226,"i tried the new 29 version but cant edit anything an error message website not available comes up with link to amazon :

"
4231,"they quickly responded to complaints and reinstated stats page this shows they listen to customers which is good rest of app is reliable and easy to use previous comment gtgt last upgrade is terrible the stats pane is a major downgrade ive lost the most valuable feature which was the page views no idea how you can do this without a warning so people can not upgrade  :  
"
4232,"the main reason i use this app is to share my posts since i updated to this version of the app it no longer updates my posts once in awhile it says pull down to refresh or something obvious i cant tell for sure because it wont let me pull it down if it keeps up this way im going to uninstall it and use my laptop to share posts it doesnt always keep up with the reader either but its not as bad as when i try to update my posts i like to see them on my phonei liked it better before i updated it :  
"
4233,"no matter what i do the post i just spent twenty minutes writing will only save as a local draft it will not publish from the app to the website and then the app crashes and i lost all my work i dont know if the app isnt working or is just pointless but i will be uninstalling unless there is an update quickly :  
"
4234,"terrible app always refers to local version if youve updated live version on another device wont let you do loads of things and navigation within boxes is really annoying i can never seem to do what i want with word press on a mobile grrrr :  
"
4235,"very new to this but seems easy enough cant add photos to my blog from the app tho i have to do it in a web browser the app doesnt open the upload box im on a samsung galaxy note 2014 edition :  
"
4236,"i just started using this app and it does not appear to be updating i go to the my posts tab and it is not up to date i guess its good if you want to ust use it to post content but not to keep up with what youve been working on :  
"
4237,"this app has been giving tons of error lately cant upload image to post sometimes it says wrong password to correct password it crashes all the time fix all these things pls :  
"
4238,"the app is great for on the go and for those such as me who dont have a computer at home the only thing i have a problem with is that i cant seem to view my site because the options get in the way anything i can do about this :  
"
4239,"if you trash a comment on your standalone blogs admin panel before doing so in your app the comment will not go away in the app any attempts to edit mark as spam or trashing the comment yields an error the only work around is to log out of the app then log back in to each and every one of your stand alone blogs quite a chore if you have several of them :  
"
4240,"still trying to get to grips with it on mobile devices very slow going need to find a guide is what i said then the next day i was contacted and given the exact guide i needed it doesnt get better than this thanks wordpress :  
"
4241,"it was working fine but now i keep getting socket time out exception selfhosted blog on hostgator used to work well till 2 weeks ago update most of it works now :  
"
4242,"please fix the upload failed no peer certificate errorwe users have chance of only 1 out of 10 success rate for post uploads everytime it fails to upload a post or to update changes to postsbut very good user interface which is buttery smoothfix the error then i will rate 5 stars :  
"
4243,"i love this app i really do but for some reason its not uploading my posts ive been sitting here for fifteen minutes waiting for it to finally decide to upload but no dice i even uninstalled then reinstalled the app its still not working :  
"
4244,"this would be a 5 star review if i could do the following insert multiple photos at the same time or add multiple media files to a post as i believe you can in the ios app and manually set the location these two things are making it painful keeping my travel blog updated using my nexus 7 :  
"
4245,"the button that sayspull down to refresh covers the title and status of the most recent post completely so that i cannot see the status or anything about my most recent post serious flaw :  
"
4246,"app used to be fast and functional have problems uploading hd photos to my site no one has answered 9 trouble reportsfrom htc one metal m8 :  
"
4247,"working with the visual editor causes any formatting and images to show as code when you post adds tags around images and such making it look horrible particularly when trying to work on a computer at home and trying to finish on my phone ruined hours of work lots of good things about the app but that pretty much ruins it for me not being able to even open a post mobile sucks :  
"
4248,"choose file button doesnt work for which i m unable to upload themes or plugins or even images i m using samsung galaxy s advance kindly fix it asap :  
"
4249,"i love this app it keeps me blogging on the go i had issues previously and learned they were due to user error right now i cant find any flaws with this app great job wordpress :  
"
4250,"the tips that show up cant be turned off and dont ever go away on whatever activity they appear on when there is a tip it is impossible to click anything behind it very annoying next in landscape they have disabled the fullscreen editor i cant see anything i am typing not all of us use tablets and all of you app devs really need to stop disabling the full screen editor that alone makes this 25 also doesnt save html like setting paragraph textalign to justify practically useless :  
"
4251,"fine for writing on the go without having to carry a laptop even without internet stats section doesnt always work very good for keeping your webpage up to date :  
"
4252,"i cant upload my post and cant see all my post please fix it its uncomfortable :  
"
4253,"this app helpsbut need a little touch there are two problems 1 cannot sync post with web version 2 duplicate post when edit post that just uploaded the older version is better :  
"
4254,"the main reason for installing this app was for the ability to send post that option is not available in the menu the only options i have are read and notification im deleting :  
"
4255,"app is usable but it doesnt synchronize properly changes made on the computer arent synchronized so its quite possible to inadvertently undo changes use with caution :  
"
4256,"works perfectly well for blogging on the go and keeping up with conversations i wish i could clean out the spam folder though :  
"
4257,"tbh the app looks great alot of options nice ui but the problem is i cant upload any posts to my wordpress site with this app gosh u guys kidding me when i try to post something it shows uploading for around 50 seconds and after that it always shows post upload failed an error occured while uploading the post even if the post contain just a heading and 3 lines of content no media files the result is same for gods sake plz fix this bug asap :  
"
4258,"gud efforts to give a great blogging experiencebut freezes a lot needs a bit updating cud give only 4 star nw :

4259,"i have had a number of incidents of data loss with this app i press the back button while composing and it doesnt save or offer to save what ive typed it happens after the third or fourth save this is unacceptable :

"
4328,"i had to make invited viewers authors in order for them to view with the app whats the deal is this some ploy to get me to pay the 99 just to keep my blog secure or is this huge bug just a very bad flaw i hope it can be corrected very soon if not then what is the point in blogging privately if my readera can mess with my blog :

4339,"worked well out of the box however i installed some security plugins that change the login page from the default for a hosted site after my site got hacked through wp and this app breaks until i can tell it where to login please let me do that instead of assuming its wpadmin this app has become useless  :  
"
4340,"my wordpress site has a two step authentication login in which i get the code from this app and i m unable to acess it now i cannot access my blog so i m leaving it go to hell :

"
4342,"people who try the product and then feel compelled to filla rating and comment with negativity why not offer whats known as constructive criticism reporting bugs and problems are the only way theyd know what to fix for later updates so why not try to find a more consstructive way to communicate :

4344,"there are a few annoying bugs like the tip to scroll down to refresh that 1 never goes away and 2 doesnt work one example is updating your view of your own posts :  
"
4345,"love the app but with the latest update the pull down refresh feature never works on my htc one i have to go to another menu option then back to stats for it to refresh frustrating to say the least :  
"
4346,"completely confused as to why a mobile app is inaccessible from a mobile device all information is correct and yet i cant get into my own account embarrassing :  
"
4347,"only issue i have is the hint pull down to refresh gets in the way of the text at the top of the screen i honestly prefer a button anyway :  
"
4348,"job the multiple accounts thing still awesome everyone should do that y do u need to view network state is there a choice blocked until valid explanation and morons who can figure this out if you are logged in then you wouldnt see the login screen because you are already logged in and whoah drafts have been syncing for 8 months so stop wishing its here :

"
4372,"i dont really use it that often but it works pretty well its good for quick postings and photo uploads if you are trying to use it as your first choice prob not a good idea cause your might want to adjust the settings or plug ins might be a little wonky and thats not wps fault its the proprietary companies that slice up the original wordpress cms :

"
4376,"the new pulltorefresh doesnt ever go away make it automatically hide as its annoying an in the way :  
"
4377,"not intuitive enough i made couple of mistakes that got me headaches first one i started a post and i wanted to save it so i pressed the arrow in the up corner to acces next options but that icon is a paper airplane that publish the post without even ask alright first use i search for something like post adjustments oh they were in the footer and changed the post to local draft but it never went to draft again in the blog worst than that i continued editing it and the next time i accessed it a message appeared something like the post is not updated do you want to and i thought of course upload the changes but what it did was download the first draft the published one overwriting the last one so i completely lost all of my work well lets see the revisions but theres nothing like that on top of all that i searched the internet for help and the only possible solution needed my device rooted before all this and search some hidden directories but it comes to happen that there are lots of people who doesnt even know what is to root an android device absolutely awful :  
"
4378,"i love when im on the go that i can finish what im doing on the computer an then take my tablet or droid and fix my blogs :

4386,"i cant upload media no matter what i try it just wont upload kinda defeats the purpose of being able to stay connected if i cant upload pics plugin support is minimal to non existant too everything else is great using a samsung galaxy s4 please fix :  
"
4387,"i was on a trip very far abroad for only 16 days and wanted a way to quickly upload photos for friends and family to see so i didnt have to resend the same photos 12xs well im embarrassed to have bothered providing them all with the link with only 2 days to account for here i am on the last day of the trip and was only able to upload 2 posts due to a media data issue i looked up just about every relatable issue and tried troubleshooting for 14 days no luck what a waste of time :  
"
4388,"has caused the app to not work anymore i am getting constant upload errors used to work fine :  
"
4389,"the latest update causes html tags to appear when i edit a post this occurs if i edit a post ive made via the app and posts ive made via web annoying to wade through :  
"
4390,"after last weeks application update my view site link permanently displays website not found so its difficult to confirm the way the page looks after a mobile postupdate :  
"
4391,"instead of my subscriptions reagee gives me a collection of blogs i dont care about unacceptably poor ui and navigation is a pain :  
"
4392,"when using the reader it doesnt load pictures from the post i wanna read what happened it wasnt like this before and no refesh doesnt help either :  
"
4393,"good app overall but many formatting changes bold italics font colours etc dont show on my website once the post is uploaded :  
"
4394,"once youre used to this keyboard you wont be able to use another :  
"
4395,"no issues so far functionality is slightly limited but you shouldnt want to manage a blog from your phone :  
"
4396,"ha mejorado ya no me da error he cambiado de blogger a wordpress y me encanta el cambio :  
"
4397,"amd now the stats wont refresh its slow and buggy go back to the beginning guys :  
"
4398,"wont let me log in             :  
"
4399,"it does not want to go trough my self hosted blog what might be the problem  :

4401,"cant upload media and many other shortcomings :

"
4404,"now difficult to post to selfhosted blogs :  
"
4405,"dat dus                        :  
"
4406,"mostly this app looks and works great and makes accessing my wordpress blog on the go easy and smooth theres just one strange and glaring oversight when you go to view posts theres no way to view only drafts etc this can make finding old draft posts that havent been published yet difficult would be a kind way to say it :  
"
4407,"be warned if you have 2step authentication enabled you are going to have a hard time the app now continuously asks for an applicationspecific password despite generating one over and over again and being allowed to log in when i log out it asks yet again useless :  
"
4408,"i am not a frequent blogger i take my time and ask friends to review through feed back requests as far as i can tell that is not possible through the app but the problem is there doesnt seem to be a guide for the icons on the app so i accidentally published something before i was ready just trying to see what the options were with the app so far that makes my experience of it not very good if you just want to write and publish and check comments it might be good for you so far for my purposes i prefer using the website :  
"
4409,"trying to create a blog and you cant customize anything only allows you to post using it off my samsung s4 yet it keeps saying computer dont install rather use your computer :  
"
4410,"notifications are very scattered some comments load as comments ive had from days ago while others wont load at all i could write better code for an app like this :  
"
4411,"i agree w the no star rating on the update i have made 3 posts via the app with no problem i have been trying to publish a post for a week i am in a country where i cant access a computer which is why i pay for wordpress great app reviews i have spent hours everyday fighting with photo uploads i have tried everything and have been sucked into a vortex of suckieness everytime i get close the app shuts down and i loose everything please fix asap :  
"
4412,"the feature set of this app is spread out all over the place implementing some basic features and some advanced features id rather have all the basic features and no advanced features i mean how hard is it to implement lists in the visual editor :  
"
4413,"i always get unable to retrieve this comment after getting a notification about a pending comment i cant approve them moderating comments is exactly what you want to be able to do on your smartphone but this app has been unable to do that for at least a year i think i love everything wordpress and automattic so a bit surprised and hoping for change galaxy s3 :  
"
4414,"i want to like this app it would be great if it worked too bad it doesnt im sick of wasting time trying to write posts then it doesnt actually publish the post and it deletes my work when i try to back out and figure out where i went wrong this app sucks the post button should publish the post period but it doesnt what the hell good is that i cant believe this amateur crap is associated with wordpress the biggest blog platform what a joke :  
"
4415,"i just tried using the app for the first time yesterday i updated a post working on it for over half an hour only to find out today that my edits were never posted to the actual site when revisiting the app today what went wrong it refreshed itself causing me to lose all the changes id wanted to do annoying to say the least not to mention that when i was editing the post through the app there was bits of coding all over good thing i am familiar with html so it was less daunting :  
"
4416,"i would love to give this app no stars instead of one i have lost every single blog post that i have ever attempted to post through this app there are so many errors such as the menu options disappearing especially if the blog post is over a few sentences long thus forcing me to delete the content it also wont allow me to copy the text so that i can save it this is a terrible terrible app and i will never use it again uninstall :  
"
4417,"i love using my word press account but it is one of the most difficult apps it has errors regularly and deletes posts before they are even posted to the main site it is discouraging me from wanting to use the android app and just blog from my laptop to avoid all the hassle even their help services are not much help in fixing the situation it is definitely better to know what youre doing ahead of time or youll feel the walls trying to keep you from this creative outlet :  
"
4418,"the install got stuck at 100 download and didnt complete it i thought this would be helpful but after the reviews i have seen i clearly doubt it :  
"
4419,"up until the latest version this was a functional but featurelimited wordpress app good for a quick draft or to authorise a comment however the latest version now presents a there is no network available message and does not appear to recognise a wifi or mobile data connection nexus 5 factory 442 has been rated accordingly :  
"
4420,"its functional for a few very basics it wont show any of my posts it can never retrieve my notifications it logs me out constantly i actually always use the browser in hopes for an update to this fairly frustrating app :  
"
4421,"i use this app on my android tablet running an older android build why is the tablet app better than this one my biggest problem is that this app doesnt push comment notifications to my phone which is one of the main reasons i got it galaxy s4 :  
"
4422,"all i want to do is have one place to be able to read blogs from three people thats all one doesnt appear unless i search for the specific url every time and another wont appear at all its a private blog but was always available on my ios the wordpress app the last is fine but thats hardly a good success rate i dont need all the advanced features just a simple blog reader :  
"
4423,"i have a self hosted blog pics wont upload except as a link frustrating when i am posting from a hospital :  
"
4424,"all of a sudden i am unable to post anything lt it always says an error occurred now when i try to post on my phone  :  
"
4425,"i m not able to download it getting stuck at 193 mb 43 tried restarting still same please do the necessary :  
"
4426,"bit of a bug with logging in not very secure i have 3wp accounts and no matter which login details i input wp takes me to whichever one it wants to eg i input login details for wp1 it might take me to wp2 or 3 this happened on first use and also after i log out not good when they all have different passwords and usernames also cant seem to add photos from dropbox :  
"
4427,"the img src is not capturing the correct text when adding images when manually editing the img url it will even be a mess should be cool but if unfixed useless after all :  
"
4428,"i have to uninstall and reinstall every couple of weeks as the application doesnt process anything i like or comment on or even approve otherwise it is great just annoying :  
"
4429,"when writing semi long posts it starts to get very slow on my galaxy s4 also it would be a great benefit to have a black background so writing didnt kill my battery so fast otherwise very useful to be able to write offline thanks :  
"
4430,"i love love love this app before the update once upated i cant post anything it says error occurred :  
"
4431,"the app currently is useless it has million of bugs posts are deleted even before theyre posted would not advice you to download :  
"
4432,"have to manually click back and forth between today and yesterday to force refresh :  
"
4433,"still cant add my self hosted site and the support site doesnt give me a solution at all using the web version on my phone is better than this thing :  
"
4434,"just installed this 5 minutes ago i can access my wp thru the computer browser but when i use the same log in credentials in this app it says incorrect details :  
"
4435,"i cant understand why would you create an apps that not meet the purpose i cannot publish the the entry that ive been working for days without realised it wasnt sync with the desktop i lost the draft stupid apps and waste my time type on my phone :

4505,"the most ridiculous and nonfunctional app ive ever seen there are so many bags i cannot even name i cannot upload any photo the scale of new post creation page is over sized that i cant see all the options the navigation is enormously vague i dont see comments ive made and blogs i follow finally the app crashes all the time well the raw job its irritating :  
"
4506,"compare to comp it has no userfor me to send an invitation to my friend this app is very slow the themesin comp can edit the menu barbut thisapp sucks this app is good but it is needed to be fix i think ill just use the wordpress in my net  :  
"
4507,"ive just published my 22nd post but it doesnt seem to have gone through although it does say it has am i missing something do i need to upgrade at this point :  
"
4508,"version 261 seems to have fixed the upload error issue thanks for the quick response im still unimpressed with the changes to the interface but i can live with that original review sgs iii with android 43 uploading a post from my phone since the update results in an error notification 80 of the time and yes i am logged in to my wordpress account also the new interface requires more steps just to send a simple post as the post settings have been moved to a separate page for no apparent reason :  
"
4509,"version 261 is giving some errors an error occurred is the display message but is working fine feature article is missing :  
"
4510,"worst frickin blog program i have ever seen i have traveled around the world and blogged about my travels with this program and it does not perform as advertised especially on android os yesterday i lost 3 hours of work due to your nonintuitive save and draft view features coupled with the program notresponding 23 times i was very frustrated using this pos program quite frankly the developer should shoot himself ha i wish thanks wordpress for absolutely nothing :  
"
4511,"this app is fantastic but id quite like to see more features theme and plugin management user management even i know i can do that on the site but it would be nice and a bbpress app would be fantastic too i cant find one in the play store :  
"
4512,"since the latest update im not getting any stats everything is 0 please fix it :  
"
4513,"it does what our says on the tin however in the latest version of wordpress the dashboard was made responsive and mobile friendly and i dont feel the app matches this or lives up to this standard :  
"
4514,"overall the app has come a long ways i just wish the dashboard could be accessed easily without going through so many menus what happened to the button for quick access :  
"
4515,"the wordpress app appears to be glitching and wont pictures shared to it straight from the gallery its exhibiting other problems as well :

4516,"wont download past 43 any time i try have enough space on phone for it very frustrating :

"
4534,"wrote a whole post the app cant upload it it just sits there as a local draft cant access stats or update the blog in any way tried to ask the developers for assistance no response terrible :  
"
4535,"really really basic making authoring posts on mobile cumbersome id like to see advanced features on it oh also whenever i click on edit post it present me the post in html what the effing fish why cant i edit in wysiwyg :  
"
4536,"in july 2013 i lowered my score to 2 stars now i am lowering it to 1 every redesign removes utility i do a lot of work from my phone and i dont always have connectivity to access the full site via my browser like i was told to do last time i complained about utility loss also as of feb 2014 the app fails to upload any new posts or changes it is completely nonfunctional :  
"
4537,"my experience of using it for a year now is not good in defense of this application the competition is so dreadfully bad it stands out as the least useless of the android blogging applications the mix of html and wysiwyg is baffling ive been unable to use it for a while now because a bug was introduced that means i receive a cannot serialize null error message when uploading posts because the jpg file extension is in upper case workaround is to change filename extension to lowercase paf :  
"
4538,"i initially liked the app until i ran into error code 83 illegal operation i was unable to publish drafts id written luckily id emailed them to myself and was able to publish once i accessed via my desktop that is still occurring as of 13114 so im not certain ill use mobile any longer unless its the android thats the issue ill try on the ipad and compare :  
"
4539,"had many great features that worked like dashboard of your site what happened the dashboard was awesome now its just another post to your blog app :  
"
4540,"im going to start using eblogger wordpress is completely impossible ive spent hours trying to make it work on several different occasions the site says that i still have 996 of upload space but wont upload whether i use the app or the website even if i make my photos much smaller sorry but blogging without pictures is completely useless for me i would pay for a space if i had used it all because i understand that a good service cant be free but this isnt good service i dont even have room to type all the problems ive had with this app i would not recommend this app to anyone :  
"
4541,"this works well if you just need to do very basic updates and limited formatting however it is missing basic formatting commands or they are hidden so that i cant find them to justify text so i end up doing a two step process enter the text i want on my tablet then have to go to the pc to format it correctly overall it does what it needs but little more :  
"
4542,"this would actually be quite a useful tool if there were a way to change the default setting to save as draft instead of publish ive only used it a couple of weeks and have accidentally published posts several times in that time embarrassing and shoddy engineering :  
"
4543,"wish you hadnt changed the way the post is written took me a while to get back to set post preferences it was much better before why change a good thing :  
"
4544,"before the update when i pressed view site it would show me my blogs but since the update it wont refresh notifications wont let me view my blogs also reader will not work as well the only thing good about the new update is the appearance :  
"
4545,"after the update i cant see the blogs i follow fix and i give a 4 the developer asked if i signed out and back in i did several times but its honestly easier to navigate the site through my browser :  
"
4546,"since the update it keeps shutting down and wont let me post my post are time sensitive so im very disappointed in this app now i have to rewrite everything do better :  
"
4547,"just like the website some settings dont save which is frustrating and annoying also an easier way to search for blogs to follow by name and an easy way to access a list of followed blogs would also be nice :  
"
4548,"every so often features stop working the only workaround ive found is to delete it and reinstall it not fatal but annoying :  
"
4549,"reply on comment doesnt work at all from the last update app became useless :  
"
4550,"please fix this problem so i can write my blog i wrote a long post now i keep getting an error saying i cant upload it because i have the wrong username or password but i dont every time i relogin i get the same issue people are bugging me to make new posts but i cant post them otherwise i love the app except for the way the cursor jumps around when i try to mess with the font edit after reading other posts and the responces to them i now see this app has become obsolete try to win us back :  
"
4551,"keep getting errors when uploading media app does not run smoothly anymore hoping for a better update asap :  
"
4552,"what does that mean i used to blog every other day on my phone and lately all i get is an error message an error occurred while uploading media cannot serialize null how do i fix this :  
"
4553,"i loved using the wordpress app but the last update is a failure so i now revert to using the web application in my browser on my phone :

4554,"the update made everything better the reader is more similar to the website thus giving the app a much cleaner look the addition of the follow button on posts is great if i could search for blogs as well id give the app five stars but until then four :  
"
4555,"hello please fix this app ive been getting the system message post upload failed sorry an error offered while uploading the post illegal character d83d thank you :  
"
4556,"on a number of occasions i have tried to publish drafts from android wordpress and nothing happens then when you try to exit the draft and save it says there is a local version of this draft are you sure you want to sync this or words to that effect i thought that local meant on my tablet it didnt and i lost thousands of words of a draft post i would recommend drafting posts in a word app and then and only then moving it into wordpress this app is too unstable and with poorly worded instructions to rely upon as a fully working and secure text generation app i have left support requests with wordpress 10 hours now and no reply :  
"
4557,"i cannot refresh any stat or notifications and since today i cannot even refresh the reader what is going on extremely frustrated i use a samsung g3 :

"
4611,"two problems i have are seeing the font when editing and finding a post that id like to work on from the posts screen i dont know what others do with this app for the most part i just want to create and edit posts if there was a way to search posts and a way to blow up the font id give this app a five :  
"
4612,"i was in love with the fact of being able to write and post on the go until twice now i would be writing and saving only to find out it wasnt saving ughhhhfrustrating also whatever i start and draft on here would not be on my pc and whatever i start and draft on my pc would not be on here such a waste and disappointment :  
"
4613,"overall this app just makes me frustrated because it keeps logging me out and preventing me from logging in i even changed my password and it still wouldnt log me in it also wont let me view my stats pages or themes i really love wordpress but remain unimpressed and disappointed with this app :  
"
4614,"i was just able to posts blogs from my note 2 on the 16th of january as of last night i am unable to post from my phone as i keep getting the error was working fine before my phone updated seriously frustrating :  
"
4615,"not pleased with the stats update please bring back top pages and whatever thats suppose to be at the top always says no stats available uodate thanks guys rating changed back to five :  
"
4616,"cannot link from blog reader to blogs i read app appears to render blank page going back closes the app other functions appear to work fine without fix this app is useless to me :  
"
4617,"i have installe this app and i could not even register i have tryed many diferent user names and pw including the ones the app suggested and still shows the message this username and password already exists in my opinion is a cheap constructed app  :  
"
4618,"when i open wordpress after i first power up my samsung tab 2 the functionality is a lot like the website but once ive opened a blog i cant go back to see my other blogs and im usually stuck in a blog that isnt the one i was originally trying to post in and hitting the back button closes the app instead of taking me back to a place where i can see all my blogs so confusing bad user experienceuser interface research :  
"
4619,"its fairly easy to create a post and simple to include pictures from your phone but on my nexus 4 it wont publish just tried it again on my nexus 7 still doesnt work complains about write permissions though the web based interface works fine :  
"
4620,"it deletes the brackets on html tags like what the frak that makes the app completely useless it posts big walls of text that resembles html instead of images samsung galaxy s4 :  
"
4621,"am i missing it i get email notifications on my android htc one sv phone that people have liked my blogs or are following me if i click on the view profile button in the email it takes me to their gavatar where i cant follow them back nor like any of their blogs if i use the wordpress app on my phone i cant find the reader or figure how to access people who have liked a blog clicking in their thumbnail by my like button again takes me to their gravatar people are loosing interest in my blog :  
"
4622,"a pretty good app it does what you need it to do it has a couple of errors sometimes when uploading photos in my blog and when i view my website within app the menu always appears and cant get rid of it when viewing very annoying overall good app though :  
"
4623,"it used to be that this app allowed more than one blog to be added to the app now i try and try to add a second but the app zooms through the sign in process without allowing me to change the information thereby adding the other blog instead it just keeps signing me into the blog im already signed in to use sigh this used to be a great app now its all but useless :  
"
4624,"this is a nice app works really well however id like to be able to filter my posts draft published pending and perhaps a search feature i have too many drafts so its a pain in the butt to scroll :  
"
4625,"this update ruined the possibility of using several accounts which makes it very difficult to update several blogs therefore 1 star and thats because i cant select zero :  
"
4626,"i have issues on my tablet with the widget every so often cuz it tells me the app isnt installed once i reinstall it works but have had to reinstall several times if this is fixed it would be great :  
"
4627,"its working but the problem is when i view it on pc the paragraph format following mobile format and its not beautiful please fix it then ill give 5 star again :  
"
4628,"good but being on the road often could you allow automatic posting of all local drafts whenever there is connection alternatively i wouldnt mind being able to multiselect postpages for an action trashing publishing etc too  :  
"
4629,"i had with keeping drafts unpublished and synchronized stripped square and angle brackets on a lengthy post other frustrating problems would not recommend :  
"
4630,"terrable it is never able to load my posts or pages i can access them on my computer but this app is terrible dont waste your time :  
"
4631,"it keeps freezing up and really difficult to navigate now i liked the simplicity of the app previously now i have no idea where to find what i need and cannot upload pictures as it freezes up :  
"
4632,"ive tried many times to use this app and each time it gives me incorrect login i know my details are correct :  
"
4633,"this app used to work so well now is hit or miss lots of times my reader will load new posts but i cant read the entire entry it force quits all the time please fix  :  
"
4634,"just got new droid maxx and now this app keeps saying it can not connect to server anyone else having same issue :  
"
4635,"the functions along with the stats page are super awesome however i received 403 error when i click view blog for my selfhosted blog :  
"
4636,"very cool to manage website from phone i manage several wordpress sites for other people ill get a call that there is a spelling error and i can fix it right away from my phone :  
"
4637,"just keep having the form fields refreshed on the sign up page no validation doesnt work :  
"
4638,"cant get past the sign up page tried to uninstall it and then reinstall but it just does the same thing which is nothing too bad looked like a good app :  
"
4639,"i previously gave this app 15 as it wouldnt upload posts from my moto g since the android update that problem has been resolved but now the app sometimes loses the last things i did so they dont get published with my posts things like the last paragraph the category i assigned or a photo i uploaded so it gets frustrating still :  
"
4640,"was a good app up until you destroyed the stats page with the onslaught of complaints how could this have made it past review and testing especially when it was touted as the main feature of the latest update please fix it doesnt give correct stats the week and month remain at 0 and as others have mentioned the page views and countries are gone also on the day the secondary tabs are mostly incorrect as well update version 251 fixes a lot of these issues still a problem with view count :  
"
4641,"something so basic is still not supported in this app after all of this time epic epic fail :  
"
4642,"cant see stats details until the next day and then its a hassle to click yesterday for each detail i think youve plenty of room to improve stats functionality :  
"
4643,"clunky multisite handling but worse edit a preexisting draft post back button hit save and for some stupid reason the new edits are saved locally to your android device not to your blog painful lesson sloppy design :  
"
4644,"it takes more than a bit to get me this frustrated i tried and tried to build my blog user name taken okay change the name it goes back to the original name i submitted i have deleted and reinstalled twice with no success this is on a note 3 so i think it should handle this what is wrong with this app should i apply on my computer and then add the app still no response from developer after numerous emails is anyone else having issues where it logs you continuously and any posts end up in draft :  
"
4645,"does not update til way way later terrible interface which most tabs wont load and then force closes i would recommend googles blogger app any day :  
"
4646,"i switched over to a selfhosted wp blog and now the app barely functions for me i was getting notifications for new comments though the notification pane said it was not available but now ive stopped getting notified when someone comments altogether i deleted and readded my blog and still no notifications :  
"
4647,"i am unable to open any blogs on the reader for android app have restarted my phone logged out and back in again seems to get stuck on a blank screen :  
"
4648,"using the app tried to sign up but after accepting username it said password too short 14 characters tried again told me my email address username already in use no support so uninstalling  :  
"
4649,"go over 1k views and stats stop cant get any historical data on total views last upgrade really made the stats terrible and that was my main reason to have this app :  
"
4650,"my stats are never correct and uptodate which is annoying but content shows up nice :  
"
4651,"since today it give me a message that cannot connect to server due to some java error any proposaladvise or solution :  
"
4652,"the previous update messed up the stats page and this new update fixed it perfect :  
"
4653,"updated on 112513spent 2 hours typing a blog post and inserting photos just to get an error and no upload grrrr :  
"
4654,"the update isnt that great the app in its previous form was quite close to being perfect however i seem to be having problems adjusting to this one :  
"
4655,"ive uploaded a grand total of one post from this app all the other 12 times i tried it always says error cant upload incorrect username or password which makes no sense since i obviously logged in to create the post it saves error posts as a draft but those drafts dont end up on my actual dashboard when i open wordpress from a pcwhich means i have to rewrite everything i wrote on my phone and upload photos from my phone to photobucket just to post something this app is pointless :  
"
4656,"logging into multiple accounts works now this is now the best blogging app blog site ive tried all the rest and none have even a third of these features :  
"
4657,"i face ssl handshake aborted error every time when i try to open posts or pages im using galaxy nexus plz fix :  
"
4658,"great app has some little bugs but it is doesnt matter :  
"
4659,"i have friends that have a blog that i want to follow but i cant find a way to look for them in the app is there a search bar that i dont know about :  
"
4660,"its even worse than blogger cant even publish posts error occuring all the time doesnt even refresh postswhat is this :  
"
4661,"needs updating it just stops working on my phone everytime i use thou its cool :  
"
4662,"whats with the new update the reader and notification tabs are gone the stats never open please fix this :  
"
4663,"cant upload posts with imageshave to upload img after through medoa tabs within the app to work otherwise post upl fails :  
"
4664,"you cannot upload a video to your blog the app unexpectedly logs you out really dissapointed :  
"
4665,"i cant upload with this new version what went wrong :  
"
4666,"the new blog posting process is somehow interrupted and doesnt finish completely if i clear the uploading notification as a user i would assume that such a process should continue in the background next if i open the app again it doesnt show any indication of the ongoing process which doesnt give me any kind of update of whether the new blog got completelyhalf way uploadedor cancelled to check this if i manually click the refresh icon on topright corner it gives a warning message which is really doesnt help the user what hisher action should be :  
"
4667,"i cant upload my post from android keep getting tbhe same error msg unidentified characters i cant upload my post from android keep getting tbhe same error msg unidentified characters :  
"
4668,"this app doesnt work when two step verification is enabled on a selfhosted wordpress blog :  
"
4669,"cannot use gravatar portion on my android because of the changes on the site it is the only thing i use wordpress for so im very unhappy :  
"
4670,"makes it easy and convenient to keep my blog up to date the only reason that i didnt give it 5 stars is because i sometimes have to go into the browser to make sure the captions were added to my pictures :  
"
4671,"wordpress is a nasty glitchy buggy irritatingly difficult to use piece of crap on my android phone and windows laptop and the text editor just lives right down to those awful standards i only use it because its become ubiquitous for blogging content but i hate it using wordpress in my phones browser crashes the phone repeatedly and using it in the app is impossible the text selection tool is massively unstable the side menu drags out when i dont want it to the blog reader doesnt work :  
"
4672,"but why is application data backup disabled makes restoring multiple accounts a huge pain  :  
"
4673,"i have write a long story and attach the image when i upload it said couldnt load image has it been moved or deleted while actually im not doing anything with the image :  
"
4674,"made a short post and it gott cut off and could edit the bottom half had to get on a actual computer to edit it :  
"
4675,"i havent found anything on the desktop version that i cant do on the mobile app this is the way all apps should be :  
"
4676,"a decent first effort but hampered by buggy text selection intermittent inability to load posts and cryptic interface :  
"
4677,"great app does what i need anytime and anywhere only downside would like a list of used tags so i dont have to try and remember what i have :  
"
4678,"i cant upload posts with the app ive tried it with two blogs and both were failed to upload posts it says error in header or something like that :  
"
4679,"112113 uninstalled then reinstalled app same problems the whole app is sluggish 112013 overall its getting worse stats are now sluggish as mud and the vertical axis of stats is much too small cannot compare well make the vertical axis bigger and i click stats on one blog but it gives the numbers for my other blog youre losing stars from me now :  
"
4680,"cant manage drafts would expect this is one of the basic feature one would expect from a mobile app for wordpress :

4748,"                               :  
"
4749,"ditto what everyone else is saying about the stats update i can no longer tell which posts people are viewing and i cant tell what countries theyre coming from i dont want to have to view the full site on my phone because then i have to login and that seems to negate the purpose of an app i really liked the stats page as it was before :  
"
4750,"last update killed all the stats i cannot see any of them just full of zeros and i have to use desktop wordpress to get info i reinstalled the app and cannot login to my account any more apparently my login and password are incorrect funny cause i use the same ones i use on my computer and which work obviously and i still got the notifications from wordpress on my mobile :  
"
4751,"having never used wordpress or this app thought i would give it ago spent an hour writing the about section clicked update and nothing happened looked about no obvious save button tried to copy my text in case it went wrong and it copied something entirely different will looking for the saveupdate function and the page went off somewhere else got back and all my text was gone tried the auto save function got a blank page tried to paste my text and that failed utter crap gui :  
"
4752,"loved the stats page in the previous versions but now im not getting any stats current or past oh im using the android version i updated my site with the latest version to see if that would make a difference but havent seen any change as of yet i need the stats without having to go log in through my pc which isnt always accessible please fix its a fivestar if this can get fixed :  
"
4753,"like so many others i find the stats frustrating yes its faster but half of the information such as country just doesnt seem to be there any more :  
"
4754,"if it aint broke dont fix it well also if it aint broke dont break it either which you did here to echo the popular opinion the updated stats page is a complete headache without the dailyindividual pagecountry views its practically useless and this tab system is a mess please bring it back to one page like it was :  
"
4755,"i actually like the new look for the stats but why have all my stats been reset to zero and theyve stayed there for days even though i can see by looking at the stats via the browser that lots of people have visited :  
"
4756,"it was a great app till latest version now the most important thing to users has been designed out you cant see views by post any more baffling id love to hear their reasoning behind it :  
"
4757,"every time i try to share a pic through our wordpress blog i get an error message regarding inability to upload media file used to work on my moto x :  
"
4758,"cant see previous stats or specific page hits now i have to go to the full site to see my useful stats the app is nearly useless to me now :  
"
4759,"is there a help forum for this app i cant find it couldnt figure out even how to publish for 5 minutes while i tried every button on the phone some help files help videos help anything would be appreciated :  
"
4760,"the latest updates have given me a dreamy experience for uploading photo galleries to wp i can manage all my best photos on the mobile app first by downloading my pics from my dslr via eyefi sd card then upload to the wp media library all from my phone the gallery options in the wp app mirror the desktop experience i feel incredibly liberated not having to go through folders upon folders on my desktop computer to manage my pics i can use a photo filter on the pics i want on the phone then post to wp im gearing up for a whole new chapter of blogging goodness old review i love wordpresson desktop ive come to the conclusion that i cant even post a basic 500 word post with 4 pictures from my nexus 4 with android 43 when i insert a photo in the post it says its there and then when i publish it disappears it short a very frustrating experience ill continue to draft posts on the wp mobile app but ill have to include images from the computer which defeats the point of mobile posting i hope wp decides to make something more than half an app many other issues make this a 2star experience :  
"
4761,"this appears to be just in code blocks a is turned into quote and if you dont spot it in time turns it into ampquot and so on makes the editor unusable :  
"
4762,"all of them gone constantly telling me 0 views 0 clicks 0 everything despite my site stats telling me otherwise i hate having to login to blog to look at my site activity this is really bad qa guys the type of which would flunk you out of a programming 101 class :  
"
4763,"as everyone has said the stats pages are all messed up everything is stated as 0 when i know that its not the case i can see my stats from a regular web browser but not through the app fix this please :  
"
4764,"what the hell happened to everything in one page now i cant see countrys nor post hits this new update gets no stars its gay want old one back :  
"
4765,"as long as ive had the app ive been unable to reply to comments using the app this is a pain because im only able to get to the laptop in the evenings :  
"
4766,"like lots of other people my stats dont work after todays update and dont tell me to use the full site link i dont want to thats why i have the app edit uninstalling and reinstalling worked thanks  :  
"
4767,"one star because the stats pages dont show any content any more since the last update plus because stats pages have been divided among several pages :  
"
4768,"the last update ruines the app the new stats are useless :  
"
4769,"i am soooo disappointed in the latest update as it relates to the stats all the detailed information is gone yuck :  
"
4770,"since the update the stats arent working fine different tabs arent showing the actual data no reader function too bad it worked fine untill now :  
"
4771,"used to work but once the update was installed it now continually crashes and stats dont work at all come on wordpress this is not like you :  
"
4772,"now i get no stats what so ever all was working before update why change :  
"
4773,"not quite sure i would call the last update an update since there were no improvements made to the app but the stats page appears to have been downgraded please bring back the old stats interface :  
"
4774,"after recent updates this application is broken stats are not displaying at all please fix it :  
"
4775,"quick press shortcut no longer works stats are all messed up :  
"
4776,"but it otherwise sucks i dread blogging with this app i dont understand why drafts are kept only on my phone and cant be saved to my servers wordpress installation i also wish the option existed for autosave stats stopped working a while ago too :

"
4780,"i miss the stats we had before id like to see which posts are viewed not only how many visits or clicks i had i want to know where they were :  
"
4781,"stats page now only shows no stats available nothing else is available even after a reinstall completely useless app now :  
"
4782,"it wont let me see themes saying error fetching themes also it doesnt update the status page it stays on 0 :  
"
4783,"tried to add my self hosted blog logged in fine but no posts loads at all it is necessary for me to be able to see recent posts and drafts as it is a mews blog media loads fine but posts are mysteriously missing :  
"
4784,"this new version is much worse than the previous one the stats section is now useless :  
"
4785,"i cant see my stats now i only see 000 in every section please bring back earlier version :  
"

4787,"after the update not able to use the app force closes every time please fix :  
"
4788,"i uninstalled the app then installed it again and now the stats page works :  
"
4789,"used to love this app but stats do not load anymore wheres the qa on this :  
"
4790,"all my stats now say zero wtf how do i get them to show :  
"
4791,"i love this app but ever since the latest update it wont show my stats at all everything is zeroes :  
"
4792,"new update broken stats reads all zeroes now :  
"
4793,"just installed new version on new phone and the reader wont work it doesnt pull up any of the blogs i follow what happened  :

4795,"no stats at all from my selfhosted blog and thats the only real reason for getting the app please fix :  
"
4796,"i needed add a listing which is a function of the theme this app does not allow it :  
"
4797,"the stats do not work          :

"
4801,"since the last update my self hosted wp stats stopped working :  
"
4802,"the latest update doesnt load my stats :  
"
4803,"lack of custom post access is somewhat annoying :  
"
4804,"waqas                          :  
"
4805,"why did you change the stats page eliminating info on which articles were read was dumb :  
"
4806,"very happy with the app in general except that any photos uploaded in a post ends up with broken img tags leading and trailing tags are removed running wordpress 371 on my site what gives :  
"
4807,"the app keeps crashing when the update was suppose to stop it :  
"
4808,"i have several sites that run wordpress and finally getting around to reviewing this wordpress app to sum it up it really isnt all that great the dashboard within wordpress by default allows galleries and custom posts all this app does is allows you to write a blog and add a photo or video there is no setting featured image adding a gallery and unless you modify the dimensions of the photo you insert it will maintain the full size just log into wordpress via the web and do your stuff there :  
"
4809,"every attempt i make something goes wrong first it would tell me my password needed a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters which it did and it wouldnt allow me to use the password now it will not even type in the text box the password when i attempt to type it please fix :  
"
4810,"this would be a very easy to use app except that it keeps saying incorrect login i can sign in on my desktop but not my phone i get notifications and can see the likes and moderate comments but cant post or do anything else please fix asap so i can actually use the app :  
"
4811,"read comments wondering if problems are being fixed security 1 concern im new but dont want sign in problems or im history :  
"
4812,"i like this app but i wish it gave the ability to manage user accounts perhaps it does and i just cant figure it out so for account and page management it would get 4 stars but with no user management it loses a star :  
"
4813,"now you have removed the other blog reader notifications options on wordpress for androidthis app is less than useless to me bring them back please i love the android app but why remove view admin as an option also reader where did that go now i cant read the blogs i follow on my phone bang goes my fave passtime between jobsbring it back come on guysget it sorted :  
"
4814,"its fantastic no more signing in on each new page i can flow throughout wordpress without the need to frustratingly sign in refresh pages and for the first time i uploaded a blog through wordpress with no problems i would like to see though a preview button when you have written a blog through app to upload i had to upload blog first to see its appearance to then only edit it a few times because of the lay out otherwise for now i have no problems thank you for considering my feedback previous :  
"
4815,"i have used this app for about a week and have successfully posted a couple of entries my complaint is that the app always gives me an error that the upload failed but my entry is posted on my blog i havent tried posting any photos yet that will be my next test im using droid mini on android 4 22 :  
"
4816,"initially i could not get it to log in using my username i eventually managed to get my email to work i was very dissappointed that it does not support cutting and pasting from other applications this make posting urls and spell checking larger post diffcult at best :  
"
4817,"i have a self hosted wordpress installation for my blog and i thought this app would help me edit and publish from anywhere but it doesnt work anything i compose in the app is locked to my phone no way to push drafts to my browser on my pc cant upload media to my wp installation on my server either trying to publish from the app gives me errors ill be replacing this app with something else its only frustrated me :  
"
4818,"i use the app mainly for the reader and not for publishing at all its too basic for publishing would be nice if i could download or save posts for offline reading bugs me that the reader has to use data all the time :  
"
4819,"doesnt load posts from my blog doesnt let me post new articles errors errors errors if it worked itd be my favourite app it doesnt :  
"
4820,"im really not sure what the other reviews are complaining about the app works great on my razr it does what it says and says what it does must be user error with the other folks :  
"
4821,"wont allow me to log in have verified versions access and passwords and nothing works useless :  
"
4822,"im not a blogger but i had to get wordpress to leave comments on some blogs and enter giveaways i dont know what has happened because im not able to leave comments on blogs using my primary email addressi can use my alternate email address but i use that one for getting my bills info i dont know much about technology but i know i need it fixedi need to be able to leave comments on blogs there should be someway to unsubscribe your account information and go back and start over any suggestions :  
"
4823,"this app used to work but now i only get this messege when i try to log in orgapachehttpnohttpresponseexception the target server failed to respond i have self hosted wordpress site and using 2 different devices with 2 different android os version i still cant log in its nice to use this app when its working properly please fix this asap :  
"
4824,"there are a few issues with this app the option of saving as a local draft has been removed which has caused major issues for me when i dont have wifi access also when you upload photos and there is an error due to a poor connection you automatically lose all the photos sizing and captioning that you just tried to upload this means you have to re add all the photos again instead of it saving as a local draft :  
"
4825,"it keeps telling me error i input my correct login information and still get error every single time i can access on desktop but with this app its a no go please fix this  :  
"
4826,"90 of the time i try to upload a post with pictures it gives some sort of mysterious error message read error connection closed by host failed to upload media which media teribble app which is disappointing since it is wordpress i end up using the wordpress website through the browser on my tablet which is definitely not as convenient :  
"
4827,"how can a password and username work online but keep coming up with incorrect password or user rediculous fix it beginning to wish i stayed with blogspot :  
"
4828,"cannot delete cannot post cannot do anything error always when trying to post :  
"
4829,"ive a self hosted site and ive created some categories for the blognews but the app defaults them back to news regardless of what i select and publish useless :  
"
4830,"using only the wordpress hosted blog i find it fair enough and workable but the sad part is that being someone who posts code on a blog it becomes a lot more tedious while doing it on a tablet cant blame the application for it  :  
"
4831,"why does wordpress require the ability to monitor us with unlimited access to our cameras the wordpress folks do an amazing job why wreck a good reputation with app abuse :  
"
4832,"spent 30 minutes in a caf over coffee getting a draft post ready to publish after first downloading this app figured the changes were uploaded over my connection made a new post noticed it was local draft hit the mysterious circle arrow button it deleted all my latest work with no prompt :  
"
4833,"nice idea simply doesnt work properly often wont let you view blogs and is unreliable just failed to load blogs again and again and once more and again uninstalling :

4836,"it works for me if it says you entered the wrong info remove the automatic space placed at the end of your username :  
"
4837,"its a really great app for blogs but can you make the blog editable because on my phone it cant editnice app thou :  
"
4838,"why the heck do you need coarse and precise location information as well as a permission for taking pictures i dont see the need for that and until you change it your app will remain uninstalled from my device :  
"
4839,"previous versions i was unable to log into my selfhosted blog however recent version appears to have corrected this issue :  
"
4840,"ive tried numerous times to log into my self hosted site on wp using this app and failing every time what is the issue  :  
"
4841,"this version is not ready for release drafts disappear post views change gui changes without notice cursor bounces around upload errors made me want to smash my nexus 7 :  
"
4842,"i cant even get past the first login screen to create a new blog very frustrating :

"
4952,"i installed this app before but i wasnt even able to log in so i decided to delete it i tried reinstalling with hopes that i can finally log in but still to no avail i even reset my password and logged on using browser but the app just wont let me log in it just says connection error :  
"
4953,"but every time i go to the view site tab i get the password is incorrect error log in works fine but as soon as i leave that tab and come back to it it i get the same error message and have to log in again its a pita with a 24 character random string password is there a way to fix that :  
"
4954,"indefinitely says my password is incorrect i sit at my desktop and use the same password and viola its fine the only way this app works is through the full site option which at that point why bother and just use chrome disappointed :  
"
4955,"still a poor baked substitute for the webbased backend wp dashboard the minimal functionality is declining and buggy with every update good attempt but long way to go even then with all the wp plugins around this app will only give you the basic wp features ever :  
"
4956,"this app used to be pretty great but it appears they have tried to simplify it and remove almost all of the functionality i cant access any of my plugins wheres my old dashboard what the hell am i supposed to do with this app now anyway good thing i have a backup if the old version :  
"
4957,"use this app daily all day and i havent been able to view my blog stats or my clients blog stats says name not associated with account which is incorrect having to use my ipad mini to check stats which is an inconvenience my note2 is my main device rating down from 5 stars to 3 :  
"
4958,"i used to love this app but after recent updates it no longer remembers the selfhosted sites i add using this app for 1 site and 1 site only makes no sense :  
"
4959,"please put view admin back to the slide out menu theres no reason why we should be going all through the settings menu to do so its more of a hassle :  
"
4960,"when i try to open the notifications screen it just goes blank needs to be fixed :  
"
4961,"i am able to login but when i try to check my blog the reader or post stuff it does not work it always says cannot connect to server anywhere i go it is still the same message i get pls fix thanks :  
"
4962,"still hoping that settings and desktop admin make a come back at some point :  
"
4963,"ever since the most recent update i cannot add a category on my phone or tab keeps foreclosing :  
"
4964,"keep telling me that the username or password is wrong sorry but i have to uninstall it :  
"
4965,"says login is incorrect tried over and over again and yet it wont work pls fix this :  
"
4966,"all i get is error 497 when i try to update this app :  
"
4967,"doesnt let me sign in to blog say try later can only post on browser not app hope gets fix :  
"
4968,"app doesnt let me add category it keeps unexpectedly closing every single time  :  
"
4969,"login failure issue is solved thanks  :  
"
4970,"if i leave an article as draft on browser 99 on 100 i cannot see it from the app i can neither see articles i just published :  
"
4971,"ilike the app but it keeps logging me outplease fix that :  
"
4972,"its cool but sometimes i cant moderate the comment what should i do :  
"
4973,"                               :  
"
4974,"works great never had an issue :  
"
4975,"great but high data consumption :  
"
4976,"                               :  
"
4977,"this app was great until the last update the part of the app that i used the most was the admin page access it was always the first thing i looked at whenever i opened up the app i maintain several wp sites for myself both business and personal i use the app for when i dont want or have time to sit down at my pc to do updates where i thought the app shined was maintaining my wp sites the app allowed me to be able to easily cycle through all my sites quickly to see if they needed plugin or wp updates after selecting the admin option i could click each site and within minutes have all the sites updated significantly quicker than using a pc to do it with the latest update to the app the developers buried the admin page access 3 clicks deep so what would take me 1 click a click per site to check update status now requires me to click into the settings then 2 clicks per site to check for update status i considered this app a 5 star app before this bizarre change im hoping it was an oversite or test on the developers part and that theyll fix this in the next update otherwise at least in my opinion theyve partially crippled the app :  
"
4978,"every single time i add a picture it messes up the code so i have to manually go back in every single time and add literally only a bracket this has been a problem for years and even did this while i used an iphone :  
"
4979,"the only useful function in this app was the admin section it is now all bit useless inconvenient and does not allow access to installed tools i have used this for a year and am uninstalling with 3 hours of this update :  
"
4980,"whats up with that quick access to my dashboard was kinda my main usage of this app almost entirely useless to me now my posts run through too many plugins for my to do mobile posts with correct results so yeah any chance of getting the dashboard back :  
"
4981,"your new update sucks big time there was no need to take out the ability to save a local draft bring back the local draft option also when i save as a draft and i have no internet connectivity i lose my work why :  
"
4982,"i would love this app if logging in werent such a pain i have to use a clunky generated password from wordpress why cant i just use my wordpress password guess i need a psssword mgmt app :  
"
4983,"it workef so smoothly on my phone it is amazing and fast and i thought it would be bad from the majority of the reviews i figured ill try for myself cuz everyone have different opinions and phone model and im loving it 3 :  
"
4984,"junk will not even let me start account to try to create a blog uninstalled continue browsing for different blog site :  
"
4985,"its difficult to compress wordpress into mobile format however some of the formatting is bad where certain fields are cut off and menu bars are partially covered by others just messy :  
"
4986,"cant upload post lags 90 of time says cant refresh try again later app crashes more often then the amount i can use it installed and uninstalled countless time :  
"
4987,"i wanted to update my blog but the aplication is slow and doesnt recognize the caps or signs  :  
"
4988,"editing a post in mobile not so easy i even always delete read more fuction when edit a post in mobile also html editing is too complicated so i can barely use any wordpress function other than just read my subcription blog and post comment when i gave comment in other blog and somebody replied it i cant see my comment that i just wrote not good :  
"
4989,"the draft post i spent an hour writing today was gone the next time i logged in its a good thing i copied it and mailed it to myself before closing the app :  
"
4990,"the latest update with category fix has broken the category option all together im using an s4 and the wordpress app crashes when tapping the category button :  
"
4991,"app works one day then update my tablet then everything is screwed up not sure if an update fail or just horrid app fix please :  
"
4992,"how on earth i am going to write travel blogs when i am in the bus with no internet and publish it when i get connected again :  
"
4993,"wont even let me successfully create the account havent got a confirmation email havent got an error mesage wtf :  
"
4994,"i used to be able to access my entire dashboard including all widgets now it is like it is a new beta version of a cheap app :  
"
4995,"dear wordpress please put view admin back to the slide out menu why theyre gone on the lattest update of wp for android  :  
"
4996,"in what bizarre universe does having view admin 20 taps away in settings make any sense :  
"
4997,"im able to access web app but here it throws as incorrect login :  
"
4998,"i was even having error downloading the app :  
"
4999,"cant manage custom post types  :  
"
5000,"i cant add images properly     :  
"
5001,"was fine before now i cant add other blogs from other accounts :  
"
5002,"i tried to sign up but apparently both my email addresses are in use i have never used wordpress beforeplease help :  
"
5003,"well i hope so maybe good or maybe bad all depends on net and usages circumstances :  
"
5004,"it used to be real good but now its all messed up it wont save my posts please fix :  
"
5005,"to my surprise i can t sort posts or filter them somehow :  
"
5006,"how come you forgot one of the important section of wordpress the custom field :  
"
5007,"i i cant even log in it says incorrect :  
"
5008,"it will not update my post and is so laggy ugh :  
"
5009,"where is the sticky option in the post edit mode :  
"
5010,"i cant login                   :  
"
5011,"not using anymore              :  
"
5012,"why dont make posting easy just like a social media right now i need to go to draft to post something reader is good but better if we can view our post and notification like how twitter app does :  
"
5013,"would be excellent but its eternally logging me out every time i switch between two elements pages and stats say it logs me out then repeatedly tells me the details im entering are incorrect when theyre not very frustrating :  
"
5014,"everytime i try to post anything it always says incorrect usernameemail and password sign in again even though its correct please fix it right away its so annoying that i cant post on my own blog  :  
"
5015,"trouble uploading pics complete pain in the behind recently but im waiting to see if that reliability improvement update will make this app better if not then i might be forced to switch to an entirely different blog platform :  
"
5016,"some elements of the app dont scroll eg calendar editor doesnt scroll whuch means you cant editcreate entries also top horizontal menu bar doesn t sxroll across great app rendered unusable on android as a result :  
"
5017,"i know i recently said there were no problems with the app but ive definitely discovered some big ones first of all theres this ridiculous autocapitalize feature that seems to always be on no matter where in a sentence you are also editing and writing posts is near impossible because scrolling down your post seems like a project in itself wish you could actually zoom out more even writing comments on posts seems like more work than its worth other than that not bad :  
"
5018,"eg when i click post option it says connection error same goes for pages link notification reader stats works fine though :  
"
5019,"i used this app daily for multiple blogs now it is useless allows only one account ui is oversized on galaxy tab original 7 version what happened guys used to be a great app bring back the one a few versions ago please :  
"
5020,"unfortunately i can not rate wordpress too favorably within 10 minutes of using this app i have had 4 crashes this is my first and only experience with the wordpress brand and so far not so good update 2 after current update im still not satisfied app does not crash but after trying to edit a post it is near impossible to move cursor to desired location :  
"
5021,"it is only a shortcut library to the main functions of web dashboard which opens at the embedded browser open at your browser and it will be less frustrating :  
"
5022,"the universal sign for save is that little floppy disk that doesnt mean post to my whole blog and email my subscibers so when i delete the post they can still see the carnage one star because the black hole option wasnt available :  
"
5023,"used to be fine but now am unable to view my posts always saying unable to connect at this time also unable to upload anything due to a media errorsort it out :  
"
5024,"worked fine before on my galaxy tab 20 doesnt work now awful :  
"
5025,"i find it impossible to use the app even writing a post is hard as it will not let me continue writing where i left off if i click elsewhere changing the appearance was even a challenge i could not use the menu bar desperate need of improvement with the navigation :  
"
5026,"but when i click on the box to type my actual blog it wont let me very frustrating it took me a hour to post a photo to my profile let me posta blog last night in a few minutes but today its malfunctioning thats annoying i will be uninstalling this app :  
"
5027,"for your fancy galaxy s4 someones jealous categories become unchecked when you add new ones fix that dingus :  
"
5028,"since updating to 241 i can no longer access the dashboardview admin area loads 404 page not found instead hoping this will be fixed in the future then id be happy to change my rating :  
"
5029,"tried different ways to log in but it would not let me this app is stupid if i can give it a negative star i would :  
"
5030,"i dont know what happened to the app it stops working on my galaxy tab i cant view the site and if i view it no post is appearing  :  
"
5031,"its hard to work with photos dont appear ill keep it for a while but im not a huge fan :  
"
5032,"image labels for comment marking are gone it is unclear what icon means mark as spam especially for screen readers :  
"
5033,"this app is extremely buggy it constantly fails to display blog postings that i click on from blogs i follow i have to close the app reopen it find the post again and click again its very annoying also when the app gives you notifications of replies to comments youve made it doesnt show you which comment of yours the person was replying to it just says in reply to your comment on and to see that comment you have to press an icon that launches a web browser annoying :  
"
5034,"cant search for blogs i know of in the reader why no search option :  
"
5035,"posts older than first page wont load editing is very clunky not worth much more than a quick post :  
"
5036,"cleared data reinstalled would be great if it synced up otherwise its just a notepad :  
"
5037,"just upgraded to galaxy iii and program will not toggle between my blogs i have to sign in and out of each to post help :  
"
5038,"hard to sign into hard to download :  
"
5039,"keeps crashing same connection error code crazy :  
"
5040,"does not work at all           :  
"
5041,"how can i search other blog posts because i cant on this app it doesnt have a profile tab  :  
"
5042,"great app but there was some problems with loading pictures onto it :  
"
5043,"its need custom post type support since some blogger used custom post type for their posts :  
"
5044,"                               :  
"
5045,"iam cannot login if account have two step authetication :  
"
5046,"cant view existing posts cant upload pictures whats going on :  
"
5047,"i dont know but now i finished my work remote :  
"
5048,"works so well i put it on my tablet and mobile :  
"
5049,"hugely basic but why cant i embed youtube videos :  
"
5050,"lumayaan bisa ngeblog lg       :  
"
5051,"this app sucks the posts from my site dont even show up in the app i can only see 4 of my posts and i have over 100 waste really sucks they cant make a good app :  
"
5052,"it doesnt give me the options of composing a blog in visual or text can only do it in text also cant add new photos when i click on select nothing happens thank you for your reply to my rating and while that does allow me to add pictures it doesnt give me the ability to alter text colour make some text a url etc in other words there is not a wysiwyg editor unless i am missing something obvious so my rating remains as it doesnt give me the ability to everything the website does :  
"
5053,"over the year there have been vast improvements both in the visual style and the ui love the sidebar that slides with all the same choices as the windows interface the main viewing screen is a bit scrunched and in view admin and stats pages they are cut off on the right hand side obliterating todays stats sometimes force closes automatically midstpost :  
"
5054,"i wish the app would give you an option to sync whats in the sever into your tablet or whats in the tablet to the server i had a bunch of posts on my blog i had to move my blog to a new server confident that i had all those posts on my tablet after the new server was setup i went to the tablet logged in with my blog account i was still able to see all my posts saved on the tablet i then hit sync thinking that all my posts were going to be uploaded well they did not to my surprise it erased them all leaving me with nothing more than a hello world post that was a catastrophic :  
"
5055,"it logs in and i can see everything normally but if i click on anything it says wrong id or password and asks me to sign in again when i put in the exact same information to login that i just did it says wrong password or id it fooled me yesterday and i changed my password i am not going to change my password every day just to use this app on mobile fix this please :  
"
5056,"appreciate quick dev response now i know that admin is accessed through settings thats a weird place for it however it cant run javascript so i lack full control of plugins better in browser :  
"
5057,"you can get notifications about comments and check stats but nothing else works you cant approvespamreply to comments which is something an app like this should have down in order to be useful on the fly :  
"
5058,"awkward slow clunky most people will give up on somthing thart is so time consumingly slow when other sitrs are application friendly snd fast needs interface that actually takes advantage of the ease of android browsing but instead is counterintuitive disappointed :  
"
5059,"i have tried several times to make long posts using this app but the text seems to disappear after a while and you need to essentially guess what youre writing save it as a draft and then proofread it on pc later on blogger is a much better app as it allows your text to scroll as you use it and not run into the keyboard to the point where you cant see what youre typing cmon seriously i know you can do better than this :  
"
5060,"ive never been able to complete even the most basic post with this app if theres a photo link or absolutely anything requiring code the app removes the codes formatting prior to saves and uploads meaning my posts just show a bunch of partial html along with my text its crazy making i just use it to reply to comments :  
"
5061,"uploading and updating posts always fail is this a bug that escapes the developers or are they simply unable to squash it the app despite its slick looks has remained this poor for some time :  
"
5062,"i am using the wordpress app both on my nexus 7 and iphone however both cant seem to upload images to the library or crop images from there the upload button dont seem to work if you have access to a normal computer it would be fine but for people like me whos travelling and having access to only their phone or tablet its quite inconvenient hope the next version can fix this :  
"
5063,"was working great until i changed my username now app forces me to sign in every time and it takes me to the mobile site not the app i cant locate any posts and data that were saved locally on the app please help :  
"
5064,"finally reloaded on my galaxy s and problems seem to be fixed not a regular blogger but nice to have it working right when i feel like using it thanx to the devs :  
"
5065,"ive started a post three times now and saved it as a draft first time i figured since i dont think i had very good service it didnt save online so when i got on my laptop it wasnt saved and then came back to the app and it was gone now its happened two more times and i havent used my laptop since please fix this edit they all just showed up uhm please get this confusion with saving drafts and all worked out i am glad they showed but it needs to be a little more stable with that :  
"
5066,"ive had some frustrations while using this so on my nexus phone i cant figure out how to save a draft so my posts get published before i want them to limited editing options says that posts havent been uploaded when they actually have been i like wordpress but this app drives me crazy :  
"
5067,"it does not even allow me to register from my galaxy 3 figure out using it for making up a website it keeps asking me to insert lower case hopeless :  
"
5068,"i cannot get the most important feature to work on this comments it has some comments downloaded in the device but will not show new comments seems to be related to authentication maybe and issues where wp is configured with 2 factor authentication posts retrieves ok and asks for verification code but comments just sits there and eventually complains about hitting too many failed login limit :  
"
5069,"i feel like abusing you guys my posts still remain as local draft the reason im not blogging you write diligently and the post remains in draft forever how difficult is it to get this app right :  
"
5070,"i constantly loose what i type when i attempt to save it need mechanism thatll do automatic local saving :  
"
5071,"i cant log in thus the app fails on all levels should be less then 1 star if the product doesnt even slightly work :  
"
5072,"so glad you fixed it it was a headache to post the article and then going to the web version to set the featured image :  
"
5073,"have been using this app for a few years with no problems but since the update it has a very annoying habit of publishing posts that are saved as drafts not good for my readers :  
"
5074,"using this app with an htc desire used to be ale to geotag posts but since latest update this option seems to have vanished or am i missing something :  
"
5075,"cant exactly rate the app because it wont let me log in keeps saying invalid usernameemail but i just signed up  :  
"
5076,"i have paid for my account and want to use it only on my phone but the app wont let me log in with my already created account un installed its worthless :  
"
5077,"i cant login help samsung s3has locked me out of my wordpress :  
"
5078,"great app i liked the previous set up better but this one is still easy to use the only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because i cant access my emotion icons on this app :  
"
5079,"whenever i click in a post that says something like 137 more words 4 more images only the words appear no images loaded unless its a gallery good app anyway :  
"
5080,"pos app edited two posts and both times it ate all the content piece of junk :  
"
5081,"unable to even log in so cant actually comment on the app itself :  
"
5082,"the app is not letting me register please fix :  
"
5083,"app says usernamepassword wrong but it isnt i even reset it 2 days ago online and still cant log in to the app :  
"
5084,"wont even let me login in      :  
"
5085,"ran a live blog from a trade fair using this and it worked a treat :  
"
5086,"                               :  
"
5087,"does what it should should get better as tablets get better for this kind of thing :  
"
5088,"nothing to see here            :  
"
5089,"i wrote several pages of an essay and saved it on my tablet it showed saved locally 3 hours later i went to see it on the net and i saw only one paragraph i went back to the tablet and it was all there i saved it again to be sure i did not lose it still not on the net or in my drafts on the net finally saw the sync button the tablet app did that and everything was synced back to a few paragraphs and before you ask the revisions were of now value either not sure how you get it to not save locally other then sync but i will never use the app again other than to read :  
"
5090,"the interface is nice and neat but its crap first click on previous post displays the post post cannot be edited afterwards all buttons become non responsive :  
"
5091,"this is worst application that i saw ever i give 0 ratting for ui one can use browser instead of this application i mean one can manage their wordpress site using brouser because no difference between this app view and web view it simply load url in webview :  
"
5092,"it would better if had the ability to show who replied whom in comments and if like previous version unapproved comments color were difference from approved ones :  
"
5093,"good application ive been using this app for months uploading photo posting hyperlink over all this app is good enough the only problem that i cant do the blogwalking :  
"
5094,"all it does is load the wordpress site inside a wrapper wont respect the fact that i changed my password takes forever to load because its loading the images for the buttons every time turns out the default is to load the dashboard website unless you click the upper lefthand corner upgraded my review to 3 stars due to nonintuitive ui :  
"
5095,"this is the easiest way to add blogs quick easy to you wordpress account nut really does need to make things easier like the webpage because adding pictures videos seems to be missing from our blogs when we wish to add them to out blogs :  
"
5096,"it doesnt work on half the stuff this app needs a lot of work going to the website its easier :  
"
5097,"this app is useless and kills my site every time i try and use it :  
"
5098,"is it just me or does everyone elses s3 not able to post their videos gimme a thumbs down if you can :  
"
5099,"replaces quotation marks between code with quot can this be fixed :  
"
5100,"needs a feature or two but excellent program :  
"
5101,"i dont have any complaints so far :  
"
5102,"thx you                        :  
"
5103,"average                        :  
"
5104,"yuu bet                        :  
"
5105,"recent fix makes everything better im now free to love the new holo design the layout is great i cant recommend this highly enough for wordpress users mines self hosted and the app still works great the only thing id like added in future versions would be a word count feature :  
"
5106,"love the look of last update and the new menu but comments are no longer loading evgalaxy ery time i try to refresh the notifications i get a message comments could not be refreshed at this time and when i insert images into a post they just disappear before i have chance to save the post and i have the start uploading them again :  
"
5107,"i like the app overall helps me post content to my blog with ease the interface is nice and crisp however the last time i switched apps and came back to find that all that i had written had disappeared not even a local draft was saved was very disappointed hope theres a feature that saves as you type or at least recovers what youve typed :  
"
5108,"the most annoying thing is when you try to press the like button and nothing happens also many features sometimes dont load so you have to refresh a few times i hope they fix this app because if it worked as advertised it would be nice :  
"
5109,"i used to blogging using wordpress now trying to delete post says post deleted successfully refresh the page and taraa the page is not deleted even it says deleted ive wrote a post and it says that posted successfully but where is it i also try to edit a post failure and its not edited what a crap this app was great :  
"
5110,"previous versions of this app were completely useless for creating and editing articles this update fixes the sync problems and usability issues that resulted in loss of data category information now even syncs properly but if you try sharing photos from other apps to wordpress it responds by ignoring the shared data and creating a blank post :  
"
5111,"i can never comment on my own or other blogs every time i try it either scrolls up to the top of the page or has an error when i try to post the comment i hope they fix it soon or i will have to stop using the app :  
"
5112,"the new update is great but ive just made quite a large posting it turns out it didnt post properly and didnt save the final copy as a local draft have to rewrite not happy  :  
"
5113,"after the update i cant find the drafts section most of my blogs require a lot of time i write them over a span of a few days without the drafts section this app is simply of no use to me :  
"
5114,"used to be a nice little app now might as well use the website or just wait till im at a computer painful :  
"
5115,"i just downloaded this app to use with my htc 3d phone and immediately want to uninstall i try to back space and it keeps the cursor at the spot i want to erase but for some reason erases the content a few sentences above so frustrating to not be able to backspace please fix this :  
"
5116,"for use on my sgs3 the old app was much better the side bar is so small i cant see what the icons are and using them is very difficult :  
"
5117,"the app is great and all but can i make one suggestion if theres any way for the app to automatically save while youre writing a blog just like on the website would be awesome just now i was writing a blog because i was in the moment and for some reason my keyboard decided to erase everything i just typed and nothing was saved im mad at my phone but if theres any way to get that feature it would be much appreciated :  
"
5118,"if when you open it its like youre not in an app at all but on a browser of the site clear the cache otherwise text jumps all over you cant select where you want to start typing it randomly shoots cursor wherever it wants erase temp files and login again :  
"
5119,"was good before now after latest update n new gui i can refresh posts n comments anymore keeps getting connection error message that was never there before in the previous version 2 stars until they fix it :  
"
5120,"extremely hard to edit posts it doesnt feel like an app but more like a nonmobile friendly website scrolling causes the grey bar at the top to jump all over the page plus many more issues :  
"
5121,"i always have to resort to using my computer to do uploads because i always have no clue of the progress of my current upload this isnt the only problem i have with the app guys something is missing wish i could say what because i need a wordpress app thats flawless and perfect like the site :  
"
5122,"not able to upload photos even after making gallery available offline in post pictures appear to be added but upon saving replaced by img which of course is not enough to display anything once that is fixed make photos from online galleries usable bare bones it works but i could wordprocess on an apple iie as well had to give up on tablet and update from computer :  
"
5123,"i have a problem with the android app i cant set the main feature image how can i solve this problem any help thanks :  
"
5124,"i only got troubles with the photos especially when i edit add more to the entry :  
"
5125,"i just added the 2factor auth plugin and i cant login with this app anymore  :  
"
5126,"it wont even let me login      :  
"
5127,"updated to 23 looks great however my homescreen shortcut disappeared and wordpress doesnt appear in my list of applications the only way i can open wp is by opening it via the play store please fix :  
"
5128,"a real bummer what i really liked about the older version of the app was being presented with a clean page for writing now the bottom is cluttered up with all the saving and scheduling option that i have to look at the whole time im writing unless i do a bunch of carriage returns the one thing i really liked about the app was the clean page but now thats gone can you please bring it back :  
"
5129,"since the update the app seems incapable of accurately storing passwords for use on the dashboard all other functions are accessible but im always given an incorrect password error message when attempting to access the dashboard issue seems to be tied to special characters in the password :  
"
5130,"update looks cooler and now it works with self signed ssl old review if i use normal http it works but when i enable ssl on my self signed ssl hosted site then it crashes :  
"
5131,"was great before but now a menu needs to be pulled up for all functions very cumbersome :  
"
5132,"trying to view stats but for some reason it says incorrect login im already logged in or its not linked to my wordpress account the need help button is useless and just links to info about jetpack :  
"
5133,"love the app but actually like the tile menu better also the shortcut is broke and had to uninstall and reinstall to get back :  
"
5134,"simple to use for on the go blog management writing though is another thing on my evo4g the edit window insists on popping up blocking the view :  
"
5135,"i have been using this app for months and it worked wonderfully i updated it last week now all i can do is look at my old post note even able to access other blogs i follow to read please fix :  
"
5136,"did you try turning you phone off and on especially when youre using third party home screensbut not limited to themupdating an app makes this happen occasionally :  
"
5137,"why latest update i cant found menu to add new blog where the menu has been move on :  
"
5138,"dashboard stats posts nothing will load since this latest update please solve :  
"

5142,"can not write khmer language   :  
"
5143,"i cant edit the widgets or pages :  
"
5144,"i just need to learn to type better on my phone  :  
"
5145,"sometimes its hard to get the right url when adding new blogs it says that there is an error for one i had to add a backslash just to get it to work also sometimes you get an error message after saving then trying to quit other than that it is great would be good if you could configure images better :  
"
5146,"syntax this is not an update its a downdate most of the functionality i value most such as adding photos revisiting and reviewing posts and gaining access to the dashboard are removed the new version of the app having less to offer than the previous if you like going backwards this would seem appealing to me the accolade update seems inappropriate :  
"
5147,"a workable application however an extra layer of security would be highly appreciated to access your account or for you to reenter your username and password again ive noticed when i login once and reopen the app again later i have immediate access to my blog if someone else handled my phone i certainly do not want them to freely interfere with my wordpress the extra layer of security could be a 4digit pass code :  
"
5148,"i dont understand why there wouldnt be a publish button on the editing page for the app to publish i have to click back then click no for prompt to cancel editing then click publish on this page very shoddy ui design making for cumbersome maneuverability please fix this its been more than 6 months since i first sent an email about it :  
"
5149,"guys i really like the app overall but the cursor was jumping around while replying to comments today i have a hard time liking posts commenting at times and i would really love to see it function without switching to web prompting me to login just to like follow or comment also it is difficult to follow others that have followed me without having to go to web login find them again etc there are also places where the text gets cut off like in stats when viewing gravatar :  
"
5150,"ive used this app on my ipod and it was wonderful buttt i dont know whays wrong with the android version so frustrating i cant publish articles in drafts and i cant view my blog properly its not user friendly :  
"
5151,"i cant even start a blog it tells me what names i can choose from but when i pick one it says its already in use so i pick another one and no matter what i pick it wont work :  
"
5152,"first feature i checked out was new post where are all my extra fields i dont post a new item unless i can include special fields include seo details and complete other plugin details for me this app is only useful for comment moderation disappointing :  
"
5153,"i like my wordpress app its generally a great way tocheck stats and comments on the go i just have a couple complaints onetheres no automatic alert system or im more techno illiterate than i ever imagined two it doesnt show replies to comments on other peoples blogs it makes ithard to maintain that interactiveness that i love about blogging three i cant find out if ive gotten more likes ratings or followithout opening the whole post there could be an alertsimilar to that for comments :  
"
5154,"server errors all over the place since the may up date update has nothing to do with my blog since other devices with previous version of app and website work perfectly fine bad update :  
"
5155,"so much as blogging is concern its good for reading blogs while away from your pc basic function there and all but writing a blog on my s3 not my favorite activity as the keypads too small :  
"
5156,"worked fine at first but has gradually become less functional initial problems were only with my dashboard now even the blog reader pane is malfunctioning uninstalling now since it has become useless :  
"
5157,"cant connect half the time and in the middle of posts it disconnects even though im sitting in the same location with full connection :  
"
5158,"have been trying to refresh and sync postscomments but doesnt work every single time i do so keeps saying not connected to internet or fail to refresh try again later this is a great app please fix it :  
"
5159,"works just fine here a little confusing as to pagespostsetc but usable as to connection errors it will crap out if there are any issues with wifi or cellular service it wont error out with why just cant connect :  
"
5160,"this app crashed on me constantly it is difficult to get more than a couple of photos on a blog and it constantly loses the photos that i have already uploaded there is lots to like but this is infuriating please fix it :  
"
5161,"when adding an image to a post i cant set alt text or remove the link off the pic this app is pathetic it has so much potential yet too little effort has been made cant even view the html editor to remove the link and change alt text this forces me to use the full site which has a very poor mobile interface to the guy bellow defending this app i am so sorry your site is so basic and your seo so poor that this app is acceptable by your apparently low standards :  
"
5162,"i downloaded the application hoping i would have similar feature as on my website but the app is unstable crashes cant do dual view too many essential basic feature missing hoping for an update soon :  
"
5163,"i really like this app its great but can i ask a favor can you pleeeease put a password option to the app its just that my friends take my phone and there is stuff they cant know thanx a bunch  :  
"
5164,"had this app on iphone and it worked great tried to use it on my galaxy s3 and it screwed up my website i now have to wait till i get home to use my computer to fix it :  
"
5165,"i really dont understand why i cant follow my friends wordpress blog it wasted me totally an hour :  
"
5166,"i got the sorry could not connect to the wordpress site message at first but went to the forum and received very fast help i was entering the address wrong all is well now :  
"
5167,"cursor jumped around all over the place when editing a post went through a tunnel on train when i came out the other side it had deleted most of my post took an hour to retrieve kept asking for login password every 2 minutes use this app at your peril :  
"
5168,"cant able to set featured image on this app but it is enabled and i can do it in desktop fix this problem :  
"
5169,"doesnt refresh recent posts or much of anything else was useful once for publishing a new post but that was about it there was no error with the blog an uninstall and reinstall of the app helped it work better but it is fairly slow when refreshing :  
"
5170,"was so relieved i can finally update photos etc on here much improved app however having increasing problems everytime i want to upload say more than 4 photos and 1 video it takes hours despite having a very fast connection i then get bored of waiting look at the post and all pic links have been removed so i have to do it all again im on my 5th go right nowand not impressed :  
"
5171,"was great now my new posts go to a local draft folder why wont it post frustrating :  
"
5172,"like somebody else here im unable to login into a self hosted blog i can access via ipad and ipod but not with my gs3 please fix :  
"
5173,"sucks slow clunky keeps crashing when wanting to view post in browser or share url not easy to tweet a post poor reader design lousy scrolling samsung s2 ics :  
"
5174,"im not a big fan of this app overall the layout on my tablet leaves a lot of negative unused space if you put the options icons on the left and had a view of your feedblog on the right it would greatly improve upon that i do not like how you can not preview or view any blog i think its a bit absurd that i have to use my browser to actually see my blogs i also noticed you can not addcreate a new blog on the app i would have to do this in the browser as well and reload my account into this app for the new blog to appear in the drop down over all the app is visually appealing quick and operates effeciently on my tablet but the missing features completely deture me from keeping this app when i can probably find a compatible blogging app that suits my needs more or just use my browser ill check back later and redownload if improvements are made i am a fan of wordpress but this app is nearly useless as is :  
"
5175,"had to delete and reinstall app to get it to even let me sign in now the app wont let me change more than two letters of previously published posts super inconvenient oh and editing feature will randomly chop off half your post for zero reason fix this :  
"
5176,"i uninstalled the app then reinstalled it and the incorrect login problem was resolved i love the app otherwise :  
"
5177,"the app is great but ive found many occasions where i add to a post in draft mode and then click the save button but the button is not active and so doesnt save my changes i now make a change click save shutdown and restart the app to write more the first save attempt always works but after that you might loose a load of work using nexus 7 and nexus 4 :  
"
5178,"after entering my email address it then tells me only to use lower case letters on log in details after amending these it no longer accepts my email address or blog name saying that they are already being used think that ill stick with blogger :  
"
5179,"after done writing a post it is hard to figure out how to get out of the text area so you can submit the post how to get out of the text area after writing a post what is the button i have to hit on my phone to show the menu :  
"
5180,"this has to be one of the best tools for working with wordpress it is a little slow at times but is hard to tell whether that is my connection or the software :  
"
5181,"you would hope that a word press app might let you edit words in an easy and simple fashion however this app fails at the most simple of copypaste operations prints text like a palimpsest when scrolling and fails to register even the most basic of changes frankly writing this is the closest ive got to producing anything coherent within 100 yards of this utterly disappointing excuse for a piece of software :  
"
5182,"if you limit your admin folder to specific ip this app is uselessyou need to use third party proxifier in order to connect :  
"
5183,"it will let me upload text posts but i cant see anything else wont let me look for blogs or see other peoples posts or anything cant even edit my profile i dont get it :  
"
5184,"it uploads the image and text but it displays the photo as a load of html links without any a a so i have to edit each image individually :  
"
5185,"doesnt link to the blog i need to view at all yet on my laptop i can view everything just shows blank screens basically doesnt work :  
"
5186,"cant log out or log in plus would be far better if it showed notifications very glitchy and rarely loads my stats correctly :  
"
5187,"have not had a single issue till now smooth and funtional nice ui too just plug in credentials and it does the rest :  
"
5188,"i like wordpress very much i think wordpress is the best blog site ever then i install this app on my phone and i was surprised the post cant be more than 1000words anyway please fix it thanks before :  
"

"
5201,"couldnt initially log into the app due to the same errors reported by other users but with some excellent support for the developer it says identified as a server side problem with mod security on apache blocking the api calls :  
"
5202,"keep giving me error in connection when i click on the posts bottom please fix it annoying :  
"
5203,"i was able to do quite a long post but it kept on cutting the end of the post i do not know if it has a word limit :

"
5233,"but why a limit on characters i wrote a post but it didnt post the whole thing wth whats the point of a blog app that lets you write as much as you want but doesnt post all of it or even save the whole thing in a draft to post the whole thing once you cam get to a pc its stupid frustrating :  
"
5234,"i like it better than the iphone version like it for quick notes quick look at stats and such the problem is you clearly cant blog only on this it lacks tons of details :  
"
5235,"i love this appi can post on the gocan add multiple blogs and can see stats but one thing i need is spam comments in app itself currently its going to browser :  
"
5236,"need to implement fast scrolling in edit box for posts its so slow trying to scroll down to where you last left off :

"
5244,"why are the pictures no longer showing for posts under the different topics in the reader they are often what draws you to read the full post initially thought it was just the apple version of the app that didnt show them but very disappointed to realise its the same for the android app apart from that the app is very good :  
"
5245,"i used the app almost every day before last update to write my blog posts since last update however the app doesnt work i tried to save a post and whole app crashed and i havent been able to use it since uninstalled  :  
"
5246,"so handy especially to share news articles ive just read on my phone one thingposts section wish there was an option to list posts in order of most recently posted first currently it seems to be oldest first load more repeatedly to get to newest although some are listed out of date order :  
"
5247,"twice now over a year when i have reset my password i can no longer log in with the app it keeps saying ive entered incorrect details but i can log in using an internet browser a great app except for the password bug :  
"
5248,"the app works well in the sparse wordpress way that i would expect on my nexus 7 however it will not allow me to post a picture i like that it wants to connect to my google gallery when i select an image it simply briefly displays sorry that media can not be retrieved from the gallery and then returns me to my sad text heavy post :  
"
5249,"i was able to post several posts and add links i am no longer able to post or ad links i cannot change text to bold or any of the other options i am very disappointed in this app blogging is my hobby and outlet and to have the application start correctly then stop is frustrating :  
"
5250,"wont refresh posts keeps saying error i signed out and everything even installed it again it worked fine before but now its frustrating :  
"
5251,"samsung galaxy s2 since the last update my posts goes to draft and then wont upload at all looks like i will have to move my blog from wordpress to tumblr or somewhere else :  
"
5252,"been using this wordpress app for a little bit i really like it its not complicated at all and i havent had any issues with it i just cant wait until they enable full html editing :  
"
5253,"this app leaves much to be desired it doesnt even update correctly like the website its choppy at best and where is the search button to look up other blogs :  
"
5254,"cant log in on the stats n most of the time it errors when i log in to my blog and after the update it gotten worst please fix it :  
"
5255,"set everything up correctly with my own wordpress blog and i get the error sorry we could not connect to the wordpress site please try again later every single time terrible app :  
"
5256,"seems to have the same problems as it did almost a year ago with posting an image directly to a blog it seems to paste the html code and not the image itself from upload text and formatting works fine but any multimedia seems not to post correctly for now leaving as 3 star until this is fixed or information is given updated same problems exist in newest version as of 122912 with posting pictures posting links dont properly add the markup just type for link video not working and much more :  
"
5257,"okay the update messed up this app it was working perfect before now i cant post anything at all please fix soon :  
"
5258,"the concept is great but the functionality leaves a lot to be desired adding categories to posts is broken so cant be used please fix so we can use this app :  
"
5259,"before the last update i could read other peoples blogs now i am sent in a circle at least i can still update my posts i used to love this app five stars worth now i am so upset i could cry :  
"
5260,"1 update categories shows error 2 some posts stuck in local drafts hello :  
"
5261,"unable to upload post to blog from stood says error in loading :  
"
5262,"but not much else if you have jetpack you can look at site stats you can also review and approve commentsthe limited functionality is why i didnt give it 5 stars i understand xmlrpc can only do so much one feature that i want to see is uploading images from the phone directly to the media library for use later there would be an entry added to the android share context menu as well for that :  
"
5263,"unfortunately the latest version cant handle video posting even a short one there is no error the video simply does not show up on a page fix it please :  
"
5264,"this app worked flawlessly until the latest update now i cant upload an article that ive been working on passively for the past week and a half samsung galaxy s ii :  
"
5265,"only thing i wish they would add is an alert if you get a comment on a blog in the notification bar other than that works awesome on zte score :  
"
5266,"this app really does just about everything i need it to do but on the website theres a spot for comments ive made and i havent found a way to get to those in the app without going to those specific blogs if im even following them to manually check can that be added to the stats screen also when looking for new blogs to follow via recommended blogs i have to follow them to even be able to see them would be better if it just linked to their page so id know if i even like them :  
"
5267,"whats the point if the app isnt working correctly it did before the update very sad day  :  
"
5268,"if only it would properly log on every time youll get only half the information you need on your phone more like a compact web browser than an application dont expect much :  
"
5269,"this is a good app but whenever i try to copy text from my posts the app crashes plz fix and will give 5 stars :  
"
5270,"wordpress has always been too intricate to use even on computer mobile app is worse :  
"
5271,"can u fix it please because i cant get access on dashboard anymore :  
"
5272,"it was working fine but lately i been trying to post put it just goes to local drafts and doesnt show up online and its frustrating  :  
"
5273,"why is my app not refreshing to show things i posted on the computer and now no post i make on my phone will go thru it keeps saying error :  
"
5274,"type in the discription box sometimes i get a done box and cant go past that point on other times theres a next box and i can publish very bothersome :  
"
5275,"now when i try to add my site to my phone it says sorry could not connect to the wordpress site please try again later :  
"
5276,"just doesnt allow me to login wordpress fix the issue :  
"
5277,"the app crashes everytime i try to look at the stats even if they say its been fixed :  
"
5278,"it wont even let me login and i am using the right login info annoying :  
"
5279,"i found myself cant even log into my blog :  
"
5280,"posts just go to drafts pointless if i cant publish my posts :  
"
5281,"the previous update i could upload multiple images but now just only one really need to fix that :  
"
5282,"it allows me to create a new blog with a new wordpress account but i cant seem to be able to create a new blog associated to my old account am i missing something :  
"
5283,"worst app does not work at all waste of time :  
"
5284,"the app itself is very well done however on my asus transformer the rendering goes haywire when the length aproaches the end of the page instead of scrolling lines get mixed together etc :  
"

"
5287,"overall the app works pretty smoothly im just having trouble using the reader it doesnt load at all :  
"
5288,"so far i havent had any problems with the app but it really needs a search feature add that and i can rate it higher :  
"
5289,"time waster has no decent functions :  
"
5290,"errors errors and more errors  :  
"
5291,"works fairly well when listing posts via the post button it duplicates each post and doesnt list all of them need to be able to rotate an image as well :  
"

"
5312,"i downloaded this app because ive heard a lot of great things about wordpress and i wanted to use them exclusively from my phone and tablet i have tried on both but the app will not respond when the start blogging button is pressed the only time it responds is to tell me that my url is taken once that is taken care of and a unique url has been entered nothing it doesnt freeze it just doesnt respond im uninstalling the app for now but ill reinstall and rerate when the issue is resolved :  
"
5313,"need wysiwyg or html editing option i cant save a poeminprogress even a local draft without the editor converting every line break to doublespacing and every sganza breakwhere i wanted doublespacingis now also merely doublespaced so theres no difference between line and stanza breaks i can manually delete all the extra lines but heaven help me if i should save the draft again or ill have to repeat the whole process aaugghh :  
"
5314,"i can writing anything i want everytime when i got new inspiration but have a problem when i try uploud a pict :

"
5324,"should not even be in android market :  
"
5325,"gud bt not perfect             :  
"
5326,"i use this a lot and as i do most things from a tablet it is genuinely critical to my blogging experience so kudos to the developer its basic but effective yes it does lose my line breaks but crucially it has decent editing and copypaste and the features it has are not too bad for what it does not have i just switch to the big version on the main site one thing i do wish it had is the ability to associate pages with other pages now that would be handy other than that great stuff keep up the good work and its free anyway people whats not to like :  
"
5327,"i continue to have problems with uploading photos as a post it fails every time this problem has been around for almost two years and has worked only sporadically on droid x with android 22 and 23 it continues to not work on droid razr m with android 40 problem is on wifi 3g and 4g :  
"
5328,"version 223 doesnt work at all keeps returning me to the home page for almost everything stats see more of a blog under read previous view of wordpress as on pc using eye icon is flaky get a tester using android htc incredible 2 and app worked fine before :  
"
5329,"i was trying to get my info for my blog on wordpress and pressed the share button so i could send it to someone so they could view it little did i know that it had given me a link to a porn site so either this is a glitch or hack of youre system if it does not get fixed i will have to report the program to google play thank you and have a nice day :  
"
5330,"when trying to update from my tablet the ap refreshes in the midst and doesnt save as a draft so i have to start over or give up im inclined to do the later until i can get to my regular computer needs work on its functionality :  
"
5331,"app keeps crashing to home screen i can post to my blog but every other action in the menu opens then crashes how can i rate an app that doesnt work properly :  
"
5332,"whenever i try to make a post and put pictures in it when i am typing they go in fine and all looks good but when i go back to the tags when to post etc page the pictures disappear then when i save the post as a draft and come back later all of the words are in one huge paragraph otherwise i would love this app :  
"
5333,"everything was great until the problems started i have multiple pages and posts and for some reason it only shows the most recent ten to fifteen postspages i have to use an actual computer to edit anything older now would love to see this fixed :  
"
5334,"i wish i could give atleast three my first tym experirnce is too bad cant see stats comments reader anything it takes more than 15mins to load a page qith a wifi connection cant think what will be its speed if connected with gprs please please fix the speed :  
"
5335,"i always forget that the app caches posts and doesnt automatically pull down the latest version so if i edit an article on my desktop if i open the mobile app and forget to hit refresh i lose paragraphs of work beyond frustrating :  
"
5336,"might have been a two star app when i lost my first post now it seems more broke than ever better think of a new name for the next release too much taint on in this one :  
"
5337,"ive used this app for months and it worked well however an update and new format made accessing stats very slow now i cant load stats at all this app is getting progressively worse :  
"
5338,"its funny how the recent update was supposed to improve on reliability when in fact the app stops working all together i can even read anyones posts anymore it says cannot refresh that sounds very reliable  :  
"
5339,"its a good app when it works ive noticed increasing forceclose issues when trying to access any number of features add to that the difficulty in accessing the more advanced features such as plugins widgets oh and the dashboard seriously in need of a tune up i think developers easily forget that not everyone has the latest greatest tech and bugslegacy issues crop up in multitudes lastly more options from the app would be nice if they dont forceclose the entire program :  
"
5340,"i use this all the time with my schedule i cant get to my main computer a lot so this lets me keep up with my blogging habit id probably have to give it up if it werent for this app :  
"
5341,"it annoys me when i am writing from the app and then i cant type anymore because i ran out of room but this is not an issue in desktop i just wish i didnt have to worry about running out of room and can type as much as i want :  
"
5342,"quick photo option does not show image or thimbnail on the post what shows is the html code showing the image location is this a bug or just a setting i am not aware of :  
"
5343,"used to work fine now on my atrix 2 every single post fails this app has been rendered useless to me :  
"
5344,"okay im taking back my 5 stars cant see if your post has been published and everything is too slow :  
"
5345,"i like this application but when i edit one article i want to see it how it is in real i dont care about the html code please develop a widget to access quickly to the post page :  
"
5346,"i have reinstalled this app countless times ive rebooted my phone as often and still i cant get the app to show anything but my stats i simply refuses to sync with pages or posts etc :  
"
5347,"i love the app so far except for one really annoying issue when i try to post a picture using the default camera app and galaxy s3 front facing camera as a quick photo the picture always goes in rotated if i take a picture in profile it shows in landscape this same phenomena doesnt happen when i use other camera apps :  
"
5348,"seems to fail posting almost everytime wish it would work :  
"
5349,"wont let me post photos to self hosted blog even with xmlrpc enabled get that fixed and it is a 5 star app sad :  
"
5350,"mainly used this app to check my statsafter the update it takes a extremely long time to load new stat layout is really badwhen it actually loads :  
"
5351,"what the hell i can access everything but the stats page worked fine before the update but now it tells me to enter my log in info and then says its wrong uninstalled reinstalled and it still doesnt work :  
"
5352,"after a recent update i can no longer log into my log i also dislike how little editing i can do :  
"
5353,"like it says since the update to my server it doesnt work at all anymore both nexus 7 and galaxy nexus :  
"
5354,"needs option to publish private so i can take notes i cant use swype while typing a post i cant click any if the options on the drop down menu from the posting screen so i cant leave unless i suspect i publish my notes i want no one to see :  
"
5355,"frustrating that i cant search for new blogs by keyword unclear if remove blog means removing it from just the app or from wordpress altogether no option to log out so am considering removing app not yet used it to editpost on my blog :  
"
5356,"they finally fixed the issue where i could only see 20 pages in my admin dashboard i can now see and edit all of the pages for my site :  
"
5357,"says connection failure more often than notpls fix it :  
"
5358,"such a poor appalways says unable to connect to the wordpress sitewhike my internet is working fine all sites opening up :  
"
5359,"add new post with photos and edit post with photos always shows error failed to upload then what is the use of this app in first place  :  
"
5360,"but now it returns me to main page every time i try to read somethingvery frustrating :  
"
5361,"this app is almost completely useless the only thing its done for me is frustrate the crap out of me :  
"
5362,"i cant check my stats people from fb cant read it almost like the link is broken :  
"
5363,"i have my blog stricty on https port 443 pictures do not show and the dashboard button shows blank screen only everything else works :  
"
5364,"have been using it for a year to post new topics and reading comments one big shortcoming is commenting on a topic replying to other comments is working but option to comment on the topic is missing :  
"
5365,"i cant even get my self hosted blog to load never mind the other problems i am reading about :  
"
5366,"but still a little slow seems like the problem must be on the server side :  
"
5367,"after the last update i cant add pics to my blog i really like this ap so i hope you fix it :  
"
5368,"i cant see other posts on a blog things dont load either :

"
5370,"im using wp as an editor on my own blog but i cant login for some reason its not recognizing my url i have deleted and reinstalled twice :  
"
5371,"it seems like the dashboard and stats would be better loaded directly in the browser :  
"
5372,"pictures are automatically rotated wrongly and unable to add any pics to a second post :  
"
5373,"gave it a 5 before when it worked :  
"

"
5395,"super app                      :  
"
5396,"useless                        :  
"
5397,"overall a really good app and a big improvement over the earlier version i tried only problem ive experienced so far is that the app doesnt sync to the site reliably so i cant choose categories i recently created on my computer when i post from the app ive tried the refresh arrows and shutting down and restarting my tablet im sure itll catch up after a while no complaints otherwise good app :  
"
5398,"using fb mobile or fb app i cannot read other mobile wordpress blogs but mine my friend made his own wordpress and has two different posts i cant read a thing please consider looking into this thanks great app otherwise :  
"
5399,"really doesnt even deserve 1 star none of my blogs are ever uploaded when i write on the go and to make it worse it saves in drafts but when i get on my laptop and check drafts there is nothing terrible app really making it difficult for me to blog as i am always on the move and this isnt helping please please please do something quick :  
"
5400,"used to be a great app new update does not post photos well one photo goes up and the app hangs and either has an error or does nothing please fix :  
"
5401,"id give it 55 stars if it wasnt for the quick video feature which seems incapable of uploaded after recording cant video blog instantly due to this setback :  
"
5402,"terrible amongst other things i cant add new posts cant see old posts cant go through comments tried to reinstall wont login rendered this app completely pointless uninstalling :  
"
5403,"relaxing love it on my ipad glad its available for android now too suggestions allow landscape mode make a sound when a card is tapped but cant be moved make taps more responsive and accurate hard to select cards sometimes especially near edges which leads to wondering did it not respond or is that card unplayable hence previous suggestion offer paid adfree version i got spoiled on the ios one compress piles when they get long so they dont cover up buttons at bottom of screen :  
"
5404,"the stats page just shows the text without any styling in galaxy s3 this happened after the new updates started coming please fix this automattic :  
"
5405,"yeah its cool can manage worpress blogs very goodone problem is that it is way to slow to load anything not cached like stats reads etc :  
"
5406,"was forced to run the update most of the functionality is there but when i try to view stats it just hangs please fix :  
"
5407,"it didnt let me log in it said id entered an incorrect username and password when id added the correct one but i uninstalled the app and then reinstalled it and now its working :  
"
5408,"will not allow me to create an account :  
"
5409,"it used to work perfectly tly now my htc one x wont let me see my stats or anything it wont even let me log on :  
"
5410,"i can view the stats of my blog when i click on postspagescomments it says connection error :  
"
5411,"wish there was an offline draft option :  
"
5412,"works perfectly but takes a little while to load the stats :  
"
5413,"no comment                     :  
"
5414,"can i view pages like listverse on this app or :  
"
5415,"ive been using this app then had an update this week now im alerted that wordpress has malware by my antivirus and have removed it from my mobile i guess this needs sorting out :  
"
5416,"works perfectly for me i dumped google blogs because their app fails in so many ways each update of this brings more functionality and it hasnt let me down once excellent :  
"
5417,"this app doesnt work on nexus 7 i wasnt able to check my posts but i can post im disappointed and i hope theyll fix it soon so i can update this review :  
"
5418,"great way of writing a post wherever you are when you have a spare few minutes you still need to log in to edit plug in settings otherwise would be 5 stars :  
"
5419,"please hide the remove blog button its placed in a very dangerous place post and pages audio player do not appear :  
"
5420,"wheres the featured image support cant find it :  
"
5421,"nice but some back navigation issues are still nagging :  
"
5422,"wish the settings for the site were native to the app though :  
"
5423,"good but latex doesnt work     :  
"
5424,"i dont really blog but thought i would try what i have found with this app is that everytime i try to post or edit a post i get an error if this issue gets fixed i will up the rating because i am unable to do anything on my phone :  
"
5425,"needs full publishing and reading capability also difficult to find what i want can never find the reblogging function :  
"
5426,"no probs                       :  
"
5427,"i havent had all the problems that others seem to be having but i dont have a high traffic blog so maybe that helps lol i do find it frustrating that if i save a draft i cannot find it again on the app have to go on the pc to continue working on it :  
"
5428,"nicely done overall but where do i edit post slug the automatically generated slugs ate annoyingly long and ugly for nonenglish titles :  
"
5429,"clean interface useful for blogging on the go understandably not so flexible or optionedup as using the fullblown interface in a a desktop browser window it wouldnt make sense to install it on a tablet :  
"
5430,"had this app last year worked great odd failed pic upload but generally worked well now i cant even log in cmon sort it out :  
"
5431,"app looks good everything for a mobile wordpress is there still it doesnt upload files correctly with images ufff it throws exceptions and cannot continue in that sense this is a useless app :  
"
5432,"app sucks on my sony s tablet allowed me to add my blog upon install then stopped working period it will not open ever good job guys :  
"
5433,"the interface isnt bad but i couldnt post from my acer iconia tablet because i kept getting an error for a bad password am i missing something or is the app really just not accepting my login :  
"
5434,"cant log in anymore on the app but i can online please fix im on ics :  
"
5435,"too slow on loading and you just cant search for a specific blog :  
"
5436,"i get error all the time i try many time :  
"
5437,"cannot even log in it says my blog url doesnt exist :  
"
5438,"the app crashes when i start typing my selfhosted account details :  
"
5439,"it doesnt let me post me anything it keep saying an error :  
"
5440,"doesnt let me search posts     :  
"
5441,"cant even log in fix it and i will reinstall it :  
"
5442,"its a bit disappointing        :  
"
5443,"                               :  
"
5444,"good and simplebut slowand where is search button :  
"
5445,"not sure what everyone is whining about it works fine :  
"
5446,"cant log in                    :  
"
5447,"just get it on your phone i luv it :  
"
5448,"just dont try to edit existing ones app will embed format code into the text and render it garbage youll have to go in through wordpress and spend a lot of time deleting out all the crap fix that wp and ill give you 5 stars until then i wont use the app :  
"
5449,"will upload pics and show them but when they post it is only in code if you edit a existing post it will put html code into it needs work fix so us on the goers can work :  
"
5450,"when the app decides it would like to work its great however connection to servers seems to be a problem many pages cannot be displayed i cannot log in to read blogs i could go on uninstalled fix please :  
"
5451,"adding photos via the camera very often crashes the app which then of course loses everything youve written if you want to use it i suggest saving every sentence unless you really enjoy retyping annoyingly this also closes the post so you have to constantly go back into edit mode thank goodness i have the keyboard dock also adding photos does work and it lets you set alignment but it doesnt seem to be able to properly type text to flow around those images so using alignment none is really the only option :  
"
5452,"have to uninstall because of privacy concerns should have to log in each time at least for private blogs andor make a log out button :  
"
5453,"doesnt work at all for self hosted wordpress login fails everytime stating no wordpress site found useless to me wont login to any of my several wp sites same error for all pointless anyway just use a browser and use regular wp dashboard this app is a blight on otherwise awesome wordpress toss it :  
"
5454,"im maybe a noob but hey why this app is not noob friendly i have an website self hosted and this rpl php or something like that error is eating me up ive enabled that on my blogs settings writing panel but still it dont get my what a shame :  
"
5455,"the app is fair in what it is capable of doing one error message that i seem to continually get is in the comments tab i am unable to login to it other than that i use this app until i am able to get to my computer :  
"
5456,"i put images in my post the cursor is blinking on an empty line in between two pictures i want my cursor control i press on the empty line image settings no thanks just want my keyboard back i hit the menu button nothing there is no keyboard available to hit backspace must use dedicated back button which does not perform desired function post is not formatted properly restructuring the post is not user friendly does wordpress really want a user friendly gui i hope also i cannot scroll up or :  
"
5457,"it was working fine until recently its not working properly some of my bookmark doesnt work due to violation of term of service some of my favorite bookmark are useless o htc evo :  
"
5458,"crashes constantly since last update havent been able to make a post since getting fed up :  
"
5459,"sometimes when a blog entry shows that it has comments you scroll down to read them but it does not display them if you scroll fast it kicks in but not all the time five stars if it can be fixed :  
"
5460,"when creating new posts or editing old ones its nearly impossible to get the cursor to where you want it repeated clicking in around the line i want the cursor to be gets it there then makes it jump back to two lines above or where ever it wants to be also editing code to existing posts messes things up currently only thing the app is good for is approvingdeleting comments when commuting wanting to create a new post i now use blogger because unlike this app it just does the job please fiximprove ive been with wordpress for years love everything else about it device galaxy s ii :  
"
5461,"another user with this same tablet had issues adding photos using the camera ive been adding 87 photos so far and havent had a single crash the app did fc once when i was switching from one account to another unlike the other user ive had no problems placing pictures on pages either but that might be because i rather use css to determine the layout of my pages rather than having to manually figure it out each and every post i guess if your stylesheet doesnt deal with images properly that the outcome of what you post might be a bit unpredictable or messy thats not really the fault of this app though not a bad app actually pretty good but has room for improvement tested this app on this tf300 on my sgs2 and on a sg note :  
"
5462,"the app has issues with displaying a large number of posts or pages s3 :  
"
5463,"crashes sporadically with absolutely no indication of error i am trying to use it with an absolutely vanilla selfhosted configuration :  
"
5464,"i see the app home page but everything i try from there gives some broken pipe java error i cant use any of the functions or features  :  
"
5465,"works but picture uploads arent cropped and styled according to sizes specified in your wordpress settingstheme :  
"
5466,"good app but not 100 working the stats option doesnt load :  
"
5467,"cant select anything on the image uploader to add an image to post pointless  :  
"
5468,"minor post edits result in html getting stripped out rendering a mess :  
"
5469,"i love the app and it makes my life easier but whenever i add photos to my posts only the first picture displays on the actual internet blog the rest wont work this angers me as it happens every single time fix this and then receive five stars :  
"
5470,"as the ios version becomes feature rich and the android edition remains subpar and barely usable :  
"
5471,"all my post for the next week are missing schedule and not posted automaticaly  :

5553,"yes i like this application its support self hosted wordpress everything is good but i cant see what i typing if i use landscape orientation in my small galaxy young the screen was filled by keyboard :  
"
5554,"really handy for checking on my blog plus i can add new posts without needing my computer can keep up with other blogs i follow too stats are good but i cant always approve comments often get an error message :  
"
5555,"if no network connection is available it happily pretends to save then wipes out your post laterless than ideal behavior :  
"
5556,"its really great for blogging and writing just anything on your mind just a quick question where do you find your drafts i recently wrote a post and wanted to edit it but now i cant find it all in all its great  :  
"
5557,"its decent enough to push a post out while on the road but very basic otherwise :  
"
5558,"seems wordpress needs a bit more work all the boxes are cut off on my screen :  
"
5559,"great for editing posts on the go but stats are very important cant get access to them any pointers :  
"

5567,"                               :  
"
5568,"for some reason it does not play nice with my transformer docking station its just fine without it but as other reviewers have pointed out it seems to have problems with the qwerty keyboard now aside from that the app is fab for managing multiple blogs i wish the image interface were more userfriendly but for straight text this is the way to go :  
"
5569,"not sure which one is causing it not to work ive enabled the blog to use xmlrpc but still get errors that i cant authenticate i have double auth for a private site using apache password protection as well as the registered users only plugin which prompts for a password before being able to access the site any suggestions i have another wp site that i host though that doesnt use either http or the registered users only plugin and it works great there :  
"
5570,"i didnt expect this app to be so buggy and crashprone it syncs and updates posts only when it wants it almost has an evil mind of its own and its main purpose seems to be to annoy if you dare to edit a post with the site admin use unordered lists or bold and then upload it on the app the tags appear in clear form that is using angle brackets waste of time fits into the new trend of beautifully designed garbage apps :  
"
5571,"wont let me log in wants to create new accts not easy to navigate when i can actually log in doesnt publish its terrible please fix it :  
"
5572,"the word press app on our web administrators iphone works great but in the droid it gives all sorts of socket error messages :  
"
5573,"had the app supported access to ones saved drafts it would have gotten five stars edit seemed it was having trouble updating due to poor internet ones drafts do load changed to five stars :  
"
5574,"will no longer allow me to read blogs on my xperia mini pro used to be a good app but each update has seemed to make it progressively worse shame no longer recommended :  
"
5575,"seems okay so far one major drawback i noticed is that you can only edit parent pages but not the subpages :  
"
5576,"the ui gets distorted pretty often and it crashes often in my htc rhyme it does its job but not very well wordpress needs to get a better programmer :  
"
5577,"clean ui but 4 new bloggers it can be a little confusing no search button thou cant search 4 new blogs a lil slow :  
"
5578,"this app would be perfect but for the fact that when you click on a post title to read or edit it it just goes to a blank screen this happens most of the time but to confuse the issue even more once or twice it works perfectly its pretty much useless as it is now though think im installing until its fixed :  
"
5579,"plz do an update wp it always forse closes and nvr updates drafts properly very hard2 post things wxs photos bc it doesnt show them uploads wr :  
"
5580,"peetty good but when i use it to edit posts parts of the post goes missing sometimes i cant add more words until i delete some its useful for reading though :

"
5585,"i want to be able to see the plugins too i have an seo plugin which allows me to make changes at the bottom of the post the app doesnt support it :  
"
5586,"while i like the app and use it a lot it keeps coming up with a login fault that wont let me load things :  
"
5587,"was working on a post and switching to other apps for reference and somewhere along the line my post disappeared not on the server or my phone :  
"
5588,"faster than pc with wifi brill app made 35 page blog others and it hasnt failed best to choose theme since latest update i cant add pics to pages :  
"
5589,"too flawed cant read blogs and even when i can theres no option to comment slow and buggy :  
"
5590,"while the new update is cleaner it has bugs with my qwerty keyboard for the main post area making every key press double cant turn off multi tap :  
"
5591,"i cant add pictures to the post it just adds the html code with out the opening and closing brackets otherwise great :  
"

"
5610,"im using the latest version and when i write a new post i cant find a way to upload it as there is no post button :

5620,"where is the special field     :  
"
5621,"this app cant access my subdomain :

5622,"plus it doesnt take much space :  
"
5623,"why cant i post links to the blogroll with this :  
"
5624,"hxjnxnx                        :  
"
5625,"first off if they complied with the new android design standards the app would look amazing other than that it has a terrible time refreshing i shouldnt have to hit the refresh button it should refresh when i request to see posts last thing i want to mention there is no support for the gallery tag none at all could be a link or something at least :  
"
5626,"after using this without a single problem for 9 months l now have a problem when writing a post once l get near the bottom of the box the cursor jumps to the top and starts writing at the end of the first sentence this makes posts longer than about 15 lines impossible until this happened l would have given it 5 stars please fix it the new update seems to have fixed this problem thank you i am now happy to give it 5 stars :  
"
5627,"not bad overall when it asks if you want to quit there should be another option that allows you to save as draft or should just allow for intermittent saving basically something that wouldnt kill a post if i quit for some reason :  
"
5628,"while typing in the post field the cursor often jumps to a different spot in the post while im typing incredibly irritating to constantly have words inserted randomly in other sentences htc desire cm71 swype keyboard :  
"
5629,"come on really the application cant even open my dashboard what use is the application at that point asus prime ics anyone who gives it good reviews has to work for word press :  
"
5630,"no way to find and subscribe to specific blogs read functions are useless multiple accounts nonfunctional :  
"
5631,"unable to exit post back and menu buttons do nothing :  
"
5632,"editor for me is broken back menu not worked android 23 :  
"
5633,"looks good but needs mor feel  :  
"
5634,"i had to change my review since the update i have lost several posts due to them getting cut off after upload i have literally had only the first third of a post show up losing everything else the draft disappears once its been published so no going back also it will not upload any images included in the post asus transformer :  
"
5635,"limits the maximum number of symbols in a post wrote a long post on the pc then used this program to edit some words saved when reviewing noticed that it cut out a portion of text from the end of the post with no way to recover it now please either fix this or let this be set in options tldr cuts the ending if it finds the post too long for it update 2 updates and still no change this makes the app pretty useless for me :  
"
5636,"since the latest update all i get is the http error 410 it lets me see my posts and stats but all uploads fail cmon wordpress get it together :  
"
5637,"when writing the cursor jumps randomly wthell man :  
"
5638,"i thought it was my phone so i factory reset my evo shift nope i still cannot share a picture and post like i could do before the last update i hope they can fix the issue as it looks like others are having the same problem which basically makes this app useless :  
"
5639,"fc also no search function for existing pages no editing in plain text this app is missing a lot :  
"
5640,"when i edit drafts under offline status and connect to internet later my updates are placed by old articles :  
"
5641,"i cant go to back to publish it becouse get stuck on text editor so i need to close the apps and enter it again to post kacau :  
"
5642,"but when i edited one of my articles i could not exit edit mode :  
"
5643,"just downloaded this and it is truly buggy please fix :  
"
5644,"this is most definitely a very functional app for managing ones website from an android device it allows one to manage posts and pages in html only mind you and do some quick uploads however the thing that i believe that this app is sorely missing is the ability to manage custom post types i have several custom post types on my wordpress site and am unable to manage them from my phone my custom post types are just as important if not more than my regular posts and those custom posts need to be accessible in the mobile app and thus would love to see that functionality added to a future version of the app likewise one cannot work with custom fields in the app and that is a bit of a drawback as well would also greatly appreciate having the ability to manage custom fields for postspagescustom post types in a future app so all in all its a very good functional app but i really would like to see a few additional features to make it even better :  
"
5645,"the latest version is fantasic much easier to navigate and the tile tablet interface is great but still buggy doesnt always list pages properly and crashes a fair amount on android 32 look forward to some bug fixes update 12012 still very buggy seems to have a lot of trouble syncing properly saved drafts seem to disappear but then they appear later refresh seems like a half refresh whatever you do always select all and copy before submitting anything just to be safe also any post created with this seems to lock the publish time vs now so if you tweak it later on a pc and publish the publish date is when you saved it on android anyway def buggy but speaks to how great the design is that it still keeps 4 stars once the bugs are worked out great app :  
"
5646,"this looks interesting but desperately lacking in features no options to work offline on posts like when you are on a device that doesnt have a permanent connection think tablets does not find any posts that are already in progress editor is absolutely basic and near useless for anything more than taking a photo and adding a comment seems there are no advanced formatting features :  
"
5647,"i loaded an unpublished post and used the app to publish it even though it shows the brackets and less than and greater than signs in the editor when publishing it removes them all revealing the code including wordpress brackets with potential php data :  
"
5648,"ics 402 galaxy nexus 23 vibrant content window comes up maximizes and when youre done you have to hit the back button loosing what you just wrote almost 100 of the time :  
"
5649,"as always this is another great work from wordpress allow us to blog from my phone itself i like another feature for this app need error msg :  
"
5650,"got much worse harder to write and danger of losing post by repeat button presses :  
"
5651,"until last update since last update i dont get notifications four month later still notifications dont work :  
"
5652,"i use this to get simple web page authoring done save your page then view the html in the advanced editor loses a point for this part being a web page though :  
"
5653,"use only for checking stats    :  
"
5654,"great app but it accepts a lot of strange words which are not in the common norwegian dictionary :  
"
5655,"finally can cut some of those blogs from my bookmarks :  
"
5656,"                               :  
"
5657,"yeah the the html editor is messed up if i make a minor change it destroys the post hyper links whole sentences insted of what i highlighted picture did not show :  
"
5658,"version 2 broke this apps functionality on my nexus s but a couple day later version 203 was out and now works flawlessly thanks to the devs for a quick response :  
"
5659,"unable to upload a new photo to an old post :  
"
5660,"post news on the move could not ask for more :  
"
5661,"i used to love using this app because it was the quickest way to get a bunch of photos into a post now it will only take one photo per post it may have lots of new bells and whistles but now i wont use this app until they allow for multiple photos in each post :  
"
5662,"several times ive tried to save posts so i cn return n finish but it nvr saves whats the point in flipping it to draft it doesnt work :  
"
5663,"avoid does not work this new version does not work and is very slow older version was much better as actually worked and was reliable htc desire :  
"
5664,"serious wordpress you are big why you update the app and some parts arent working again stats arent working after they work :  
"
5665,"it used to work but now i cant get the app to work on my phone nexus s 4g or tablet asus transformer please fix :  
"
5666,"the latest version layout is cool and user friendlyhavent try to upload media thoughwell i write much rather than uploading mediahowever i hope it works :  
"
5667,"this application almost always loses half the post every time i try to use it thats true for all three android devices phones and tablet that i use ive tried it in every version for the last year and they all suck :  
"
5668,"otherwise how can i edit my post to include new headings :  
"
5669,"editor still need improvement lists become individual list eg ul li li li li ul become ul li li ul ul li li ul :  
"
5670,"on htc thunderbolt running 23  :  
"
5671,"the previous version was much better on both counts this one barely gets the job done rather than remake the user interface to be even less like the desktop maybe instead add support for excerpts or image alignment :  
"
5672,"love the update menu screen is perfect can you move the trash icon more to the left on the top bar small phone big fingers almost an accidental delete a few times  :  
"
5673,"i cant stand wysiwyg editors they never do what i want please give an option for html editing the rich text editor is completely messing up my posts :  
"
5674,"this app was useful in the previous version but the new ui has made it impossible to update from my lg optimus v i cant find a way to save any changes i make also this app in every version ive used is ok for basic blogs but not for a ecommerce site that are running wp i will try to go back to the previous version or seek a new app :  
"
5675,"the post editor is horrible now all of my html br tags are now showing up as double spaces just terrible the formatting in the editor us seriously unusable :  
"
5676,"when typing post only single letter can be typed no quick texton my x10 experia mini pro cant type with keypad u press once t it becomes tthhee :

5678,"majorly bad update keep getting errors when trying to approve comments please fix asap :  
"
5679,"initially thought it was great but just lost a post 8 times no autosave and both trying to publish or save as a draft erased all my work :  
"
5680,"multiple bugs on my mytouch4g slide and the developer email is invalid :  
"
5681,"if you go to edit a long post there is a text box limit that will clip your post and destroy the remainder when you publish very annoying :

"
6099,"i think wordpress has am excellent clean interface for writing better than google docs or the native notes app however if i edit a draft while offline or i have poor wifi connection at the moment i click save my file is lost i cant even access the version before editing this means that i cant really use this app if im going to have to make backups in another writing app i might as well just do it there :  
"
6100,"i was continously updating a draft post that i had written when i was working on it on my desktop computer the updated versions of my post did not transfer to the app which caused a lot of frustrations when i realized that that the post i wanted to update again had been reverted to an older version on the app the updates made to posts should be automatic and smooth between the app and the desktop verison i had to uninstall the app since its usefless to me in that regard :  
"
6101,"for years i have loved wordpress the pc version of wordpress i always always loved you can do anything with it but on pc years ago it got tiresome because unless you got a team or the right tools its hard to code or it takes money i love the wordpress app because now the mobile version is even more simple and yet i about gurantee the code and skins will be so easy anybody can do it which in this day in time tools like wordpress are always important but there is nobody like wordpress :  
"
6102,"i used this on my phone as i preferred word press over tumblr but the mobile client isnt as responsive it would get stuck on uploading pictures frequently despite me working on wifi instead of data i have high speed internet and tested other sites to determine whether it was me or the app it was the app great when it does work just has issues with pictures and gifs :  
"
6103,"konichiwa i really dont understand why there is so much bad reviews it was fine to me besides im pretty sure most of the people only blog and dont make apps i tried it and it was fine it might not be high class but it works i recommend this to all the new bloggers you might find it good for your blogging happy blogging minna :  
"
6104,"i have been trying to upload images for quite some time and the media simply will not upload i uninstalled and reinstalled the app made sure my themes and plugins on my self hosted wordpress blog were all updated checked the dimensions of the image there is a progress bar when the image is being uploaded and no matter how many times i try or how long i waitthe image doesnt get uploaded and there is always an error :  
"
6105,"i was previously able to view my blog in app on my android but for the last week i cant pointless having app if can only see the blog in external browser as its too small dont know why its changed but have uninstalled as no use to me now will have to update via desktop disappointed that wp cant fix this i contacted numerous times and got no response :  
"
6106,"this app is very useful when you can use it and edit your site as you please in order to access themes and edit the website layout i chose i have to log in again and then it doesnt even go through in order to log in i have to recreate a password and log in and then it does it again the next time i want to make changes this is ridiculous please change it the app is free and should be functional i would consider paying but i dont want to pay for something i cant even use :  
"
6107,"when i type something on a post then attaches a photo then continues typing on the same post that photo sometimes mysteriously disappears it gets kinda frustrating when my post needs several photos and they keep disappearing as i type please fix and the new user interface looks like its opened from a browser i think the previous ui looks neater n gives greater convenience i feel that the layout now defeats the purpose of a mobile app :  
"
6108,"okay so it logs in correctly and i can access the first page of the app but as soon as i click something else a sort of menu slides up asking me to login again and when i do that it gives me an error saying login incorrect or site does not exist judging by all the reviews i would say dont install this app  :  
"
6109,"clean app but has some bugs still media randomly will have sync problems and will show error blog post cannot be published and shows a generic red error notice these are kind of core things that needed to be used on a wordpress site :  
"
6110,"ive been working on my blog for a day and it wont let be personalize anything i tried contacting support but im tired of waiting i downloaded wix instead way more satisfied and there support is there right when i need them :  
"
6111,"it does not allow me to use italicised words in my title i hope they will do something i want to write something about a book i have recently finished but it doesnt allow me to italicise the name of the book in the title of my blog i want to enlighten people in wordpress that there are times when you might need an italicised title thank you :  
"
6112,"love wordpress really thought this would be great but it wouldnt let me start a blog with the details already held for me used alternative email address set up blog and then next log in attempt didnt recognise id set up a blog fed up with trying to use it :  
"
6113,"updated not very obvious how to connect self hosted websites should be blatantly obvious at the login page already i uninstalled this once because of it talk abou not wanting users original no support for self hosted websites :  
"
6114,"its alright if youre looking to do very basic things but if youd like to use it as you would the main site good luck laggy unresponsive and a tendency to freeze unexpectedly youre better off waiting til you have computer access :  
"
6115,"hello why cant you guys bring small dashboard like in desktop wordpress with so little options this app is useless for real website developer this app is fit for bloggers who can update blogs like updating status on facebook very disappointed indeed i unintalled unintalled with frustration need to bring in more tools :  
"
6116,"ive used this for some time on my nexus 7 and it works fine except from image upload not sure what happens but its impossible to get any image uploader to work same problem as i have from the actual wordpress admin itself :  
"
6117,"i hate logging in to wordpress it says i have the wrong password i reset it try to login and wrong password i have reset password 4 today wish there was customer service i used the new password to login to wordpress on my labtop and the wrong password user name combo worked there but it says i have no website yet i liked this app because it would remember passwords but everycouple months the app stops working and will not upload posts correct now i uninstalled app and reintalled app :  
"
6118,"i make a post with 35 pics with captions and i try to upload after failing upload i go to my posts and find that the entire post had been deleted so now i can start again and redo everything please fix bug :  
"
6119,"since update the photos wont stay put one star because i spent way too much time and i have to wait to fix it :  
"
6120,"i used to love this app until things started changing for the worst doesnt refresh o sync what ive done online sometimes doesnt show up here and vice versa cant even read notifications :  
"
6121,"i cant approve comments and i cant post blogs from my samsung galaxy s fix it and i might consider using your app for android until fixed no dice uninstalled as a waste of my time :  
"
6122,"i am not able to publish my posts from wordpress app i had selfhosted blog i dont know the problem my desktop app is not working maybe it is the problem of jetpack or app please help me out from it i want my problem to be solved from the service provider as soon as possible :  
"
6123,"i love this application but out of nowhere it logs me out and after entering my correct username and password it tells me my login is incorrect i have reset my password and this doesnt help i had this issue before as well but i simply un and reinstalled it and this fixed the issue however the fact that i have to do it again is annoying ive only had the app for a week so crashing twice is not acceptable :  
"
6124,"i cant use this app anymoreall my posts get stuck on local draft after hitting publish and yesterday one id worked on for an hour disappeared completely im uninstalling and will go the online version bummer :  
"
6125,"i downloaded in less then 10 more in my fiends mobile for they quickly post their blog in wordpress bcoz of first i downloaded about five mont ago and i have get enought surprise for this work really its awesome  :  
"
6126,"i run my own website and this app will not allow me to post anything it wont show my posts and all other settings when changed brings up an error message im logged into my account ok as i can see statistics through jetpack very frustrating :  
"
6127,"the updated version have some bugs everytime you launch the application it ask for the login as you login to your self hosted site it gives a error that site already exist in your app bot no way to log in to your website if this bug is fixed will give 5 stars :  
"
6128,"i have this app for over a year it was fine all the time at the moment nothing works so i deleted it and made a reinstallation of the app now it has an error and i cant login anymore whats going on :  
"
6129,"the old version allowed me to upload but now it only allows you to upload current pics i have pics already in my phone i want to use but wont let me wordpress come ongive us a choice to go back if we want to :  
"
6130,"works great for my selfhosted blogs my only complaint is image manipulation is very limited i use this to write drafts then add final links etc at the pc ymmv :  
"
6131,"uninstalled bc of constantly force closing freezing up my phone also theres no guide or help on how to set up a blog too many options overwhelming :  
"
6132,"ive tried to create my site many times to no avail its just too difficult to set up too many steps  :  
"
6133,"i have a site for my class and students and then a site for an organization i sponsor everything i try to log out of the organization site and log into my own it sends me back to the organization site it also wont let me add an existing site even tried uninstall and reinstall and it defaulted again to the organization site not helpful at all :  
"
6134,"i tried using wp mobile app to post to my blog it reset most of my theme feature selections to the default it took a long time to set everything the way i wanted it visually now i have to sit down at my desktop and redo a bunch of it  :  
"
6135,"but this app froze my sony xperia tablet the moment i tried to compose a post had to do a soft restart to uninstall it worse than useless :  
"
6136,"i mean i dont usually gripe about such things but the wait for the posts to load is simply ridiculous whenever i delete a post or edit it it doesnt update and reflect quickly the wait is more than a minute and during the period im not allowed to look through my posts im so annoyed that i came to complain about it gosh :  
"
6137,"the app is awesome the ability to personalise your blog is subpar anything you can find on any other app but there seems to be a major problemi cant login even after trying a dozen times and when i do login i cant access my posts or anything at all apart from that i cant edit my posts because the process never completes im not sure why this happens but i noticed that it works slightly better when using wifi instead of mobile data i tried using other apps and they all work fine please fix this :  
"
6138,"i have a blog which i cant access through the app it says something along the lines of couldnt access please try again later whats more i cant access any wordpress blog pages through the browser either are there compatibility issues funnily enough if i export the link to pocket i can read it fine but how do i access it through the app :  
"
6139,"this app deserves negative stars why does it need to be able to use my camera to take pictures access my photos or see what im seeing i cant believe more people dont object to this invasion of their privacy uninstalling :  
"
6140,"the app never used to crash and now it crashes at least once or twice everyday also the notifications used to appear instantly and now while the push up notification notifies me that there are comments on my blog the notifications feed doesnt show those comments i have to now go to my app settings and force stop the app and open it again each time it crashes or the notifications dont show up sorry to have to delete it but i cant work with a faulty app please fix it :  
"
6141,"i dont like ios as much as android but your app for iphone and ipad should be the same as the app on android you released v31 and were still stuck in the 20 range you have to do better than this guys :  
"
6142,"i like the look and feel of this app but it has a fatal flaw i have never been able to upload a post it always fails and unless i have written my post in draft form first it looses everything ive written hope they sort this issue as i would like to use word press :  
"
6143,"i used to love and very actively use this app i went to use it today and it refuses to let me on without entering a pin a pin i never created and have no knowledge of i went on the desktop site on my account found no way to set a pin over a year of blogging and im locked out of my account for no reason ughhhh tried contacting the support w no response this is insane :  
"
6144,"useless please fix it i cannot log in to update my site the new version is no longer compatible with android i am on lg g3 and cannot log in log in works fine from pc :  
"
6145,"it is worst cant able to login from app though i am opening my blog through desktop all the time it is better for nothing sheer disappointment :  
"
6146,"could be good but its useless due to the problem with establishing connection i have to reload 10 times for my post list update its the same with pages stats publishing a post even with login i tested this on many wifis with data on on different devices same problem everywhere fix it and ill give you 4 stars update if i could id rate this app 5 its pure crap i was writing a long post but this app only due to its problems with connection only saved the first paragraph uninstalled :  
"
6147,"im uninstalling this purely because it doesnt sync with my computer i have drafts on the app that i know have been published on the computer i have drafts on the app that do not appear on the computer version its a waste of my time and disappointing :  
"
6148,"photo uploads never seem to work just hangs or says error this is super inconvenient whats the point of having the app if you cant add pictures to your posts :  
"
6149,"unusable cant write text for blogjust says editcant edit same in site confusing and too many buttons that seem to do absolutely nothing 1 star is too much6 months laterstill cant add any textcomplete messdone my online blogs elsewhere this is junkps they replied here send them a email i didno reply zero support for a useless app :  
"
6150,"i got this app so that i could write blog drafts when my computer wasnt handy its terrible at this i can only see half the writing area as the un collapsible menu blocks it when i try and write every sixth letter is actually typed into the box and the app tries to close the window before im done and without saving not worth the aggravation :  
"
6151,"the worst app i came across i wonder how wordpress could release such an useless app never connects to self hosted site i can do the things better with browser i am disappointed :  
"
6152,"i love this app but there is one important function missing from the previous version read more function is missing this means that a lengthy article will be displayed on my homepage except i visit a web browser to shorten it 5 star if this is corrected :  
"
6153,"whats the point i can log into my site much faster directly through the web than i can with the app its difficult to edit anything as the screen jumps around when you try to scroll if theres a wysiwyg editor i couldnt find it it added formatting to a post i had started on my computer which is funny because in the preview all the formatting is stripped ill stick with working directly via the web thank you :  
"
6154,"i am not able to upload a new image for my profile as i click on the choose file button there isnt any link that could open pleae help its been a long time for this requst kindly see through it :  
"
6155,"the app has no flaws for me it functions smoothly and i have no complaints about it there is however one feature i would personally like to see an upload feature so that it isnt necessary for me to write the post up in wordpress itself :  
"
6156,"i have published a blog post one week ago on my computer and today i decided to start writing a new post on the mobile app i suddenly saw the blog post that i have already published and shared it on all the social media accounts in the draft section i was confused so i clicked on it when i clicked on it the draft from one month ago opened the post without any pictures and half of the text missing i thought that it was super weird so i checked it also on the computer and the original post that was already published was gone i could only found the draft my heart stopped and everything was lost thank god that the whole article was posted to my email when it was published so i could just copy paste everything the app is not refreshing and updating the posts that are already published so i will not use it anymore :  
"
6157,"this couldnt support my samsung galaxy core phone i would like to try this on phone but i really cant cause it wont let me please do something about this i may have the same situation for others out there thanks :  
"
6158,"not sure why but it stopped refreshing the posts on blogs i follow i uninstalled it for a fresh start and cant even reinstall whats up wordpress :  
"
6159,"wordpress is my free app to post my personal blog for seven years i have been blogging on wordpress with no complaints the only drawback is that occasionally the folks over at wordpress change something that is not broken in the software consequently the fix creates a glitch in the app that takes a while for wordpress to correct :  
"
6160,"wont publish the blog when its finishedwaste of time this would be better if they fixed that problem i lost my work cuz i couldnt save :  
"
6161,"it is boring and difficult to use your blog doesnt show up at discover dont waste your time :  
"
6162,"when i uploading a photo in media library it take infinity time upload but my network connection is not having problem :  
"
6163,"doesnt wanna load properly takes no images in totally shitty upgrade this app to a better version then i think everyone will like it :  
"
6164,"one blog post and immediately everything went black could not wake the phone long press nothing finally rebooted app will be immediately uninstalled what crap is that :  
"
6165,"aug 14 wp your android app nearly messed me up by not syncing desktop edits not cool 2 stars old review it often thinks mobile edits r more important than local edits then asks if you want to overwrite but a lot of times thats not what i want but theres no other choice ultimately i get so confused i find myself uninstalling and reinstalling alot crazy i know great productivity booster i recommend this to colleagues also an update fixed another bizarre unrelated save issue :  
"
6166,"i used to give the app 5 stars but they changed something with an update and i lost selfhosted access through this app if wordpress would simply start making youtube video tutorials for setting up these type of apps and server prerequisites support would be much simpler dozens of people having the same problem asking for help in the wordpress forums and being treated like trash wordpress support system along with this app sucks :  
"
6167,"everything but stats seem to work when i click on it it opens up and than returns to main menu :  
"
6168,"im not sure what the bug is or if it is a feature but i have been working on a document for some time that i was nowhere near ready to publish thinking that draft and saving means that you know it is going to save your post as a draft shouldnt raise any questions unfortunately as pretty as the app is every time i close my tablet or disconnect from wifi for a moment every supposedly saved draft immediately deletes itself forever leaving only the post title behind why why :  
"
6169,"looks great but the photo upload still does not work even if u just want to use something from the media gallery it does not work well same issue as a year ago :  
"
6170,"i use and have relied on wordpress for some time and love the ease of use on my home computer that being said just tried using the mobile app for first time and am not thrilled attempted to make one post three times resulting in crashinglocking up my phone and failing to upload unistalled until fixed droid turbo :  
"
6171,"i set a blog for my alter ego jill hobbley but im finding it very difficult and confusing not to mention frustrating to use i started adding a blog as myself as jill i uploaded photos which appear to be missing now im trying to find the dashboard which you may aswell search for blindfolded i wanted to link it to jills flikr account may as well take a course in quantum mechanics ok im not the most technically computer literate minded but ive used many other sites with more success i think theyve over complicated it for us practically minded people :  
"
6172,"i remove this app because it kept rebooting my phone and saying that my battery was dead the insulation was no problem sign up was easy and i entered my first blog after removing the app i had no problems with my phone :  
"
6173,"i had the same issue when i first downloaded this application i didnt realize the upload image button is actually really small and inbred right hand corner once you start typing an article i gave this app four stars as all its missing is the function to control every aspect of your blog and a featured image function if it had those of never use my computer again app looks lovely on my motorola xoom :  
"
6174,"i have used many apps and must say this is the worst ui ever how difficult is it to get the display aligned correctly totally useless compared to the great website :  
"
6175,"dont trust this app the syncing feature is the worse i spent hours yesterday writing a post posted and when i opened the post on the app i was going to change the name the app synchronized a draft from 6 days ago when i started to write the post on my phone instead of updated the posted text on the phone i lost hours of work because now i only have this text from 6 days ago edit at the same time i wrote to help support and 4 days after still dont have an answer :  
"
6176,"why do you have to have a wordpress account to login to ethnicelebs in 2014 i could login with my gmail but now when i try to login it says the email could not be sent possible reason your host may have disabled the mail function what the heck does that mean i tried multiple times to login by installing the wordpress app but im still not receiving emails to retrieve my forgotten password its sooo complicated why cant i login to ethnicelebs with my gmail anymore  :  
"
6177,"what happened to the view site option i dont want to have to go to the internet to view my site thats the entire point of having the app :  
"
6178,"new update is not good for me i cant give the spelling check anywhere although youd read over your work youll still want an autocheck :  
"
6179,"learning wordpress is a nightmare and the app isnt any more user friendly also i hate how you cant delete your account the help forums are all outdated because they dont match the actual site or app i think ill stick with tumblr for my blog :  
"
6180,"the new update now i cant upload my photos media error it took me 8 hours to get 4 of five photos to upload i had to change it to gallery etc its a mess i just did a factory reset on my phone it happened before and after i rest i cant find the link on the website for tech support so lame the app was perfect before im visually impaired i could see it better light blue and white is a graphic design nightmare and its harder for me to see the new app type accessibility :  
"
6181,"terribly confusing wordpress likes to send you in very baffling circles when addingediting any content i spent about 90 minutes trying to set up a very basic blog and im so frustrated im looking elsewhere bummer :  
"
6182,"ill give it more stars after i see how it works i just had to get a new password which i wish i new i could have logged in with google :  
"
6183,"i write fanfiction aaand when im ready to post it wants to act up it either spaces things that dont need to be or deletes all my work from being in draftsi love the app but cmon :  
"
6184,"whenever i try to login to open my website it show cant log in whereas i put all the information correct not updated instantly and no more option is given very slow to use app has not so much tools to make it convenient :  
"
6185,"i dont ever give negative comments but my goodness creating a post is so frustrating i do not recommend this app sorry :  
"
6186,"wont show photos after uploading them whenever i upload a photo this is not shown in the post please fix this issue i already asked in help and support more than a week back and got no answer :  
"
6187,"i dont understand how this app acquired a 47ish rating considering that both the most helpful reviews the most tecent ones are very predominantly negative guess its as one reviewer suggested that the latest beefup was disastrous rating with the average here pending a full evaluation :  
"
6188,"i cant open any part of it without an error would love to own quick blogs from this thing but the app sucks will use the browser :  
"
6189,"i should have paid attention to previous reviews i was able to post one page to my blog but then could not publish anything else :  
"
6190,"laggy sticky side menu slow to respond and prone to crashing works fine on my phone no complaints but the tablet version is useless asus me173x running android 422 :  
"
6191,"i would have given it a better rating if i could upload images fast as i write my posts uploading takes ages despite fast internet connection because pc version gets the images uploaded readily so i know its the apps fault fix it soon otherwise there will be more people giving bad reviews :  
"
6192,"dont get me wrong i love wp trouble is this android app crashes every time 2 seconds after opening just cant get it to work :  
"
6193,"i like my text to be aligned as justify and there are no text alignment options i can see i cant publish posts from my phone without having to go on desktop and justify text first its a pain as is uploading images to a post but for rough drafts this thing has changed the way i blog please fix missing features or just direct me to them if ive missed them thanks edit thank you for responding of course i should have thought of that its not as easy as the kitchen sink but itll do :  
"
6194,"started using yesterday formatting is kind of hard so later formatted with laptop then edited from app and lost all formatting ie bold h2 etc :  
"
6195,"even though i tried this with different keyboards its editing capabilies are poor they dont come up to any of the external editors that i have on my tablet compared to the pcweb version this is crippled one reason i would like an external editor is that i have a lot more formatting capability and the ability to snapshot or for example undo deletions rather than sweat coding more editor functions simply flipping into an more capable external editor seems sensible there are a lot of management features in the pcweb version that i consider very basic being able to edit the raw html code to correct errors or carry out formatting that the visual mode doesnt permit is one again this might be resolved with an external editor edit in visualtext or in html switch perhaps the simplest demonstration of whats lacking is to run the tablet and the pcweb version side by side i realize there is a screen real estate issue especially when trying to run this on a 45 inch phone but perhaps thats a case of you shouldnt be doing that however other applications i use do have panels that pull down or pull in from the side out of space  :  
"
6196,"i have done many online blogsall done in minsgave wordpress a trymonths agocould not use site nor app to complete my blogalways says click edit linkno edit link in site or appgave up and decided to try again and ask for help got a few replysall useless as app will only sat click edit link which does not existlook at all those 1 star reviews wordpress may be good on a computeri have no access to oneits junk on mobileupdateafter a few useless emails from help got a get ready ipwe will send you helpful info by emailno info in email useless company useless site useless appjunk :  
"
6197,"even i cant edit my blog not user friendly :  
"
6198,"as other reviewers have said the app freezes up whenever i try to insert an image i have a samsung note 101 and every attempt has locked my tablet i attempted an uninstallreinstall and the same problem occurs the window also begins cutting off longer posts the post is still there but you will need to use your updown buttons instead of the scroll function to see it there is also no menu once you get to the post screen navigation between dashboard post and post options is difficult i have been frustrated by the last several updates to this app if you need to only post text it isnt so bad hence two stars any posts beyond simple short text should be done online :  
"
6199,"was such a not very good and unhappy experience that i wanted to delete the entire thing almost immediately and deactivate the account i found it really difficult to do basic things i thought this app was about making things easy :  
"
6200,"app is great but wordpress aint for me i dont like the user interface of wordpress its quite unfriendly uninstalling this app because i dont have a need of this now :  
"
6201,"stats not working maybe url matching issues again had to revert an older version i found in the blogs :

"
6209,"lost a peice i had been working on for months without explanation looked everywhere for it to no avail i adore the website but the app is too sensitive and comes off as cheap and doesnt do wordpress any justice :

"
6211,"it not even letting me sign up i was trying to sign up with google tried many times it didnt work i was recommended by my friend to use this app but now i think this a crappy app not working at the start what the hell :  
"
6212,"my daughter downloaded the app and she loved it she said that it was the best blog app shes ever had so i tried it and o thought the same thing :  
"
6213,"i was so stupid not to think that theres an app for wordpress because i currently have 20 tabs on google where in all of it are wordpress sites :  
"

"
6218,"its terrible it claims to have new customization but you can hardly do anything with it go back to the drawing board guys :  
"
6219,"i thought this app would come in handy but it was very slow and annoying it takes tomorrow to load and it is not mobile friendly its hard to read and see blogs its a complicated app and very irritating fix this guys but for now uninstalling :  
"
6220,"uninstalling this because it requires the use of xmlrpc on your site xmlrpc has been shown recently to be vulnerable to hackers which is why ive disabled it on my sites unfortunately it looks like ill never be able to use this app because the developers are uninterested in addressing the issue :  
"
6221,"good to use annoying to design accidentally clicked off the main page and ended up having to start over :  
"
6222,"i was able to use it now nothing comes up on it speed is terrible and you can check anything on it please fix this app :

"
6230,"wasnt expecting much but this works great for posting to my selfhosted wp instance :  
"
6231,"couldnt access my site as useful as a chocolate fireguard :  
"
6232,"why did you create an app where the user is prevented from navigating back to a place they need to get to in order to be able to perform tasks one the user has visited how is it that you could have produced this app for someone to be able to manage their own wordpress blog yet without providing the ability for the client to navigate both forwarard and backward within the website you have got to be kidding meseriously :  
"
6233,"its hard to use on a phone when you want to add pics or links i tried adding a badge i had and it would show up and hard to understand the tools when blogging basically guessing on what you do :  
"
6234,"no option to search for images in the media gallery when uploading a post this can be a tedious job :

"
6238,"but even worst then an useful application a lot of options are missing and the ui isnt so good work :  
"
6239,"installed several months ago new version has many more options and though its much simpler than the website didnt expect a full version of the web keeps getting better every time i open :  
"
6240,"horrid ive had a selfhosted site for years and the app says it works with selfhosted but for the last year every time i turn around the connection is broken with no real explanation of why or how what worked before now doesnt work when you finally manage to figure out what broke and get it working it breaks somewhere else horrible will be leaving wp to get away from it i cant reliably post unless i have my laptop with me which makes staying with wp less and less rational today its telling me i have no website  :  
"
6241,"dont waste your own time downloading this app it sucks and it is not worth it :  
"
6242,"they all have common problems like posts being deleted randomly posts not being published etc i am about to continue blogging in my tablet but it seems that all i read are negative reviews :  
"
